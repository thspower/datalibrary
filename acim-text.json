    "content": "<p><sup>1</sup> 1. There is no order of difficulty among miracles. One is not\n“harder” or “bigger” than another. They are all the same. All\nexpressions of love are maximal.</p>         <p><sup>2</sup> 2. Miracles as such do not matter. The only thing that matters is\ntheir Source, Which is far beyond human evaluation.</p>         <p><sup>3</sup> 3. Miracles occur naturally as expressions of love. The real miracle\nis the love that inspires them. In this sense, everything that comes\nfrom love is a miracle.</p>         <p><sup>4</sup> 4. All miracles mean life, and God is the Giver of life. His Voice\nwill direct you very specifically. You will be told all you need to\nknow.</p>         <p><sup>5</sup> 5. Miracles are habits and should be involuntary. They should not be\nunder conscious control. Consciously selected miracles can be\nmisguided.</p>         <p><sup>6</sup> 6. Miracles are natural. When they do <em>not</em> occur, something has gone wrong.</p>         <p><sup>7</sup> 7. Miracles are everyone’s right, but purification is necessary first.</p>         <p><sup>8</sup> 8. Miracles are [a form of] healing. They supply a lack, and they are\nperformed by those who temporarily have more for those who\ntemporarily have less.</p>         <p><sup>9</sup> 9. Miracles are a kind of exchange. Like all expressions of love,\nwhich are <em>always</em> miraculous in the true sense, the exchange reverses\nthe physical laws. They bring <em>more</em> love both to the giver <em>and</em> the\nreceiver.</p>         <p><sup>10</sup> 10. The use of miracles as spectacles to <em>induce</em> belief is wrong, or\nbetter, is a misunderstanding of their purpose. They are really used\n<em>for</em> and <em>by</em> believers.</p>         <p><sup>11</sup> 11. Prayer is the medium of miracles. Prayer is the natural\ncommunication of the created with the Creator. Through prayer love\nis received, and through miracles love is expressed.</p>         <p><sup>12</sup> 12. Miracles are thoughts. Thoughts can represent lower-order or\nhigher-order reality. This is the basic distinction between\nintellectualizing and thinking. One makes the physical and the other\ncreates the spiritual, and we believe in what we make or create.</p>         <p><sup>13</sup> 13. Miracles are both beginnings and endings. They thus alter the\ntemporal order. They are always affirmations of rebirth which seem\nto go back but really go forward. They undo the past in the present\nand thus release the future.</p>         <p><sup>14</sup> 14. Miracles bear witness to truth. They are convincing because they\narise from conviction. Without conviction they deteriorate into\nmagic, which is mindless and therefore destructive, or rather the\nuncreative use of mind.</p>         <p><sup>15</sup> 15. Each day should be devoted to miracles. The purpose of time is to\nenable man to learn to use it constructively. Time is thus a\nteaching device and a means to an end. It will cease when it is no\nlonger useful in facilitating learning.</p>         <p><sup>16</sup> 16. Miracles are teaching devices for demonstrating that it is more\nblessed to give than to receive. They simultaneously increase the\nstrength of the giver and supply strength to the receiver.</p>         <p><sup>17</sup> 17. Miracles are the transcendence of the body. They are sudden\nshifts into invisibility, away from a sense of lower-order reality.\nThat is why they heal.</p>         <p><sup>18</sup> 18. A miracle is a service. It is the maximal service one individual\ncan render another. It is a way of loving your neighbor as yourself.\nThe doer recognizes his own and his neighbor’s inestimable worth\nsimultaneously.</p>         <p><sup>19</sup> 19. [Miracles make Souls one in Christ.] They depend on cooperation\nbecause the Sonship is the sum of all the Souls God created.\nMiracles therefore rest on the laws of eternity, not of time.</p>         <p><sup>20</sup> 20. Miracles reawaken the awareness that the spirit, not the body, is\nthe altar of truth. This is the recognition that leads to the\nhealing power of the miracle.</p>         <p><sup>21</sup> 21. Miracles are natural expressions of total forgiveness. Through\nmiracles, man accepts God’s forgiveness by extending it to others.</p>         <p><sup>22</sup> 22. Miracles are associated with fear only because of the fallacious\nbelief that darkness can <em>hide</em>. Man believes that what he cannot see\ndoes not exist, and his physical eyes cannot see in the dark. This\nis a very primitive solution and has led to a denial of the\nSpiritual eye. The escape from darkness involves two stages:</p>         <p><sup>23</sup> A. The recognition that darkness cannot hide. This step usually entails fear.</p>         <p><sup>24</sup> B. The recognition that there is nothing you <em>want</em> to hide, even\nif you <em>could</em>. This step brings escape from fear.</p>         <p><sup>25</sup> 23. Miracles rearrange perception and place the levels of perception\nin true perspective. This heals at <em>all</em> levels, because sickness\ncomes from confusing the levels.</p>         <p><sup>26</sup> When you have become willing to hide nothing, you will not only\nbe willing to enter into communion but will also understand peace\nand joy. Your commitment is not yet total, and that is why you still\nhave more to learn than to teach. When your equilibrium stabilizes,\nyou will be able to teach as much as you learn, which will give you\nthe proper balance. Meanwhile, remember that no effort is wasted,\nfor unless you remember this, you cannot avail yourselves of <em>my</em>\nefforts, which <em>are</em> limitless. Only eternity is real. Why not use the\nillusion of time constructively?</p>         <p><sup>27</sup> 24. Miracles enable man to heal the sick and raise the dead, because\nhe made sickness and death himself and can abolish both. You are a\nmiracle, capable of creating in the likeness of your Creator.\nEverything else is only your own nightmare and does not exist. Only\nthe creations of light are real.</p>         <p><sup>28</sup> 25. Miracles are part of an interlocking chain of forgiveness which,\nwhen completed, is the Atonement. This process works all the time\nand in all the dimensions of time.</p>         <p><sup>29</sup> I am in charge of the process of Atonement, which I undertook to\nbegin. When you offer a miracle unto any of my brothers, you do it\nunto <em>yourself</em> and me. The reason <em>you</em> come before <em>me</em> is that I do not\nneed miracles for my own Atonement, but I stand at the end in case\nyou fail temporarily. The purpose of my part in the Atonement is the\ncanceling out of all lacks of love which men could not otherwise\ncorrect. The word “sin” should be changed to “lack of love,” because\n“sin” is a man-made word with threat connotations which he made up\nhimself. No <em>real</em> threat is involved anywhere. Nothing is gained by\nfrightening yourselves, and it is very destructive to do so.</p>         <p><sup>30</sup> 26. Miracles represent <em>freedom</em> from fear. “Atoning” really means\n“undoing.” The undoing of fear is an essential part of the Atonement\nvalue of miracles.</p>         <p><sup>31</sup> The purpose of the Atonement is to restore <em>everything</em> to you, or\nrather to restore it to your <em>awareness</em>. You were <em>given</em> everything when\nyou were created, just as everyone was. When you have been restored to\nthe recognition of your original state, you naturally become part of the\nAtonement yourself. As you share <em>my</em> inability to tolerate lack of love\nin yourself and others, you <em>must</em> join the Great Crusade to correct it.\nThe slogan for the Crusade is “Listen, learn and <em>do</em>”: Listen to my\nvoice, learn to undo error, and <em>do</em> something to correct it. The first\ntwo are not enough. The real members of <em>my</em> party are <em>active</em> workers.</p>         <p><sup>32</sup> The power to work miracles <em>belongs</em> to you. I will provide the\nopportunities to do them, but <em>you</em> must be ready and willing since you\nare already able. Doing them will bring conviction in the ability, since\nconviction really comes through accomplishment. The ability is the\npotential; the achievement is its expression; and the Atonement is the\npurpose.</p>         <p><sup>33</sup> 27. A miracle is a universal blessing from God through me to <em>all</em> my\nbrothers. It is the privilege of the forgiven to forgive.</p>         <p><sup>34</sup> The disciples were specifically told to be physicians of the Lord and\nto heal others. They were also told to <em>heal themselves</em> and were promised\nthat I would never leave them or forsake them. Atonement is the natural\nprofession of the Children of God, because they have professed me.\n“Heaven and earth shall pass away” simply means that they will not\ncontinue to exist as separate states. My word, which is the resurrection\nand the light, shall not pass away, because light is eternal. <em>You</em> are\nthe work of God, and His work is wholly lovable and wholly loving. This\nis how a man <em>must</em> think of himself in his heart, because this is what he\n<em>is</em>.</p>         <p><sup>35</sup> 28. Miracles are a means of organizing different levels of consciousness.</p>         <p><sup>36</sup> Miracles come from the below or subconscious level. Revelations come\nfrom the above or superconscious level. The conscious level is in\nbetween and reacts to either sub- or superconscious impulses in varying\nratios. Consciousness is the level which engages in the world and is\ncapable of responding to both. Having no impulses from itself and being\nprimarily a mechanism for inducing response, it can be very wrong.</p>         <p><sup>37</sup> Revelation induces complete but temporary suspension of doubt and\nfear. It represents the original form of communication between God\nand His Souls, involving an extremely personal sense of closeness to\ncreation which man tries to find in physical relationships. Physical\ncloseness <em>cannot</em> achieve this. The subconscious impulses properly\ninduce miracles, which are genuinely interpersonal and result in\nreal closeness to others. This can be misunderstood by a <em>personally</em>\nwillful consciousness as impulses toward physical gratification.</p>         <p><sup>38</sup> Revelation unites Souls directly with God. Miracles unite [Souls]\ndirectly with each other. Neither emanates from consciousness, but both\nare <em>experienced</em> there. This is essential, because consciousness is the\nstate which produces action, though it does <em>not</em> inspire it. Man is free\nto believe what he chooses, and what he <em>does</em> attests to what he\nbelieves. The deeper levels of his subconscious <em>always</em> contain the\nimpulse to miracles, but he is free to fill its more superficial levels,\nwhich are closer to consciousness, with the impulses of this world and\nto identify himself with them. This results in <em>denying</em> himself access to\nthe miracle level underneath. In conscious actions, then, his\nrelationships also become superficial, and miracle-inspired relating\nbecomes impossible.</p>         <p><sup>39</sup> 29. Miracles are a way of <em>earning</em> release from fear.</p>         <p><sup>40</sup> Revelation induces a state in which fear has <em>already</em> been abolished.\nMiracles are thus a means, and revelation is an end. [In this sense,\nthey work together.] Miracles do not depend on revelation; they <em>induce</em>\nit. Revelation is intensely personal and cannot actually be translated\ninto conscious content at all. That is why any attempt to describe it in\nwords is usually incomprehensible. Revelation induces <em>only</em> experience.\nMiracles, on the other hand, induce [interpersonal] <em>action</em>. Miracles are\nmore useful now because of their [<em>impersonal</em>] nature. In this phase of\nlearning, working miracles is more important, because freedom from fear\ncannot be thrust upon you.</p>         <p><sup>41</sup> 30. Miracles praise God through men. They praise God by honoring His\ncreations, affirming their perfection. They heal because they deny\nbody-identification and affirm Soul-identification. By perceiving\nthe spirit, they adjust the levels and see them in proper alignment.\nThis places the spirit at the center, where Souls can communicate\ndirectly.</p>         <p><sup>42</sup> 31. Miracles should inspire gratitude, not awe. Man should thank God\nfor what he really is. The Children of God are very holy, and the\nmiracle honors their holiness.</p>         <p><sup>43</sup> God’s creations never lose their holiness, although it can be\nhidden.  The miracle uncovers it and brings it into the light where\nit belongs.  Holiness can never be really hidden in darkness, but\nman can deceive himself about it. This illusion makes him fearful,\nbecause he knows in his heart it <em>is</em> an illusion, and he exerts\nenormous efforts to establish its reality. The miracle sets reality\nwhere it belongs. Eternal reality belongs only to the Soul, and the\nmiracle acknowledges only the truth. It thus dispels man’s illusions\nabout himself and puts him in communion with himself <em>and</em> God.</p>         <p><sup>44</sup> 32. Christ inspires all miracles, which are really intercessions.\nThey intercede for man’s holiness and make his perceptions holy. By\nplacing him beyond the physical laws, they raise him into the sphere\nof celestial order. In <em>this</em> order, man <em>is</em> perfect.</p>         <p><sup>45</sup> The Soul never loses its communion with God. Only the mind needs\nAtonement. The miracle joins in the Atonement of Christ by placing the\nmind in the service of the spirit. This establishes the proper function\nof the mind and corrects its errors.</p>         <p><sup>46</sup> 33. Miracles honor man because he is lovable. They dispel illusions\nabout him and perceive the light in him. They thus atone for his\nerrors by freeing him from his own nightmares. They release him from\na prison in which he has imprisoned <em>himself</em>, and by freeing his mind\nfrom illusions, they restore his sanity. Man’s mind <em>can</em> be possessed\nby illusions, but his spirit is eternally free. If a mind perceives\nwithout love, it perceives an empty shell and is unaware of the\nspirit within it. But the Atonement restores the Soul to its proper\nplace. The mind that serves the spirit is invulnerable.</p>         <p><sup>47</sup> 34. Miracles restore the [Soul] to its fullness. By atoning for lack,\nthey establish perfect protection. The strength of the Soul leaves\nno room for intrusions. The forgiven are filled with the Soul, and\nthey forgive in return. It is the duty of the released to release\ntheir brothers.</p>         <p><sup>48</sup> The forgiven are the means of Atonement. Those released by Christ\nmust join in releasing their brothers, for this is the plan of the\nAtonement. Miracles are the way in which minds which serve the spirit\nunite with Christ for the salvation or release of all God’s creations.</p>         <p><sup>49</sup> 35. Miracles are expressions of love, but it does <em>not</em> follow that\nthey will always [be effective]. I am the only one who can perform\nmiracles indiscriminately, because I <em>am</em> the Atonement. You have a\n<em>role</em> in the Atonement, which I will dictate <em>to</em> you. Ask <em>me</em> which\nmiracles you should perform. This spares you exhaustion, because you\nwill act under direct communication.</p>         <p><sup>50</sup> 36. Christ-controlled miracles are part of the Atonement, but\nChrist-guidance is personal [and leads to <em>personal</em> salvation]. The\nimpersonal nature of miracles is an essential ingredient, because\nthis enables me to control their distribution. Christ-guidance leads\nto the highly <em>personal</em> experience of revelation. This is why it\ninvolves <em>personal</em> choice. A guide does not control, but he <em>does</em>\ndirect, leaving the following up to you. “Lead us not into\ntemptation” means “guide us out of our own errors.” “Take up thy\ncross and follow me” means, “Recognize your errors and choose to\nabandon them by following my guidance.”</p>         <p><sup>51</sup> Remember that error cannot really threaten truth, which can <em>always</em>\nwithstand it. <em>Only</em> the error is really vulnerable. You are free to\nestablish your kingdom where you see fit, but the right choice is\ninevitable if you remember this:</p>         <p><sup>52</sup> <em>The Soul is in a state of grace forever.<br />Man’s reality is\n<strong>only</strong> his Soul.<br />Therefore, man is in a state of grace\nforever.</em></p>         <p><sup>53</sup> Atonement undoes all errors in this respect and thus uproots the <em>real</em>\nsource of fear. Whenever God’s reassurances are experienced as threat,\nit is <em>always</em> because you are defending misplaced and misdirected\nloyalty. That is what projection always involves. Error is lack of love.\nWhen man projects this onto others, he <em>does</em> imprison them, but only to\nthe extent that he reinforces errors they have <em>already</em> made. This makes\nthem vulnerable to the distortions of others since their <em>own</em> perception\nof themselves is distorted. The miracle worker can only <em>bless</em>, and this\nundoes their distortions and frees them from prison.</p>         <p><sup>54</sup> 37. Miracles are examples of right thinking. Reality contact at all\nlevels becomes strong and accurate, thus permitting correct\ndelineation of intra- and interpersonal boundaries. As a result, the\ndoer’s perceptions are aligned with truth as God created it.</p>         <p><sup>55</sup> 38. A miracle is a correction factor introduced into false thinking\nby me. It acts as a catalyst, shaking up erroneous perception and\nreorganizing it properly. This places man under the Atonement\nprinciple, where his perception is healed. Until this has occurred,\nrevelation of the divine order is impossible.</p>         <p><sup>56</sup> 39. The Spiritual eye is the mechanism of miracles, because what It\nperceives <em>is</em> true. It perceives both the creations of God and the\ncreations of man. Among the creations of man, it can also separate\nthe true from the false by Its ability to perceive totally rather\nthan selectively. It thus becomes the proper instrument for reality\ntesting, which always involves the necessary distinction between the\nfalse and the true.</p>         <p><sup>57</sup> 40. The miracle dissolves error, because the Spiritual eye identifies\nerror as false or unreal. This is the same as saying that by\nperceiving light, darkness automatically disappears.</p>         <p><sup>58</sup> Darkness is lack of light, as sin is lack of love. It has no unique\nproperties of its own. It is an example of the “scarcity” fallacy, from\nwhich <em>only</em> error can proceed. Truth is always abundant. Those who\nperceive and acknowledge that they have everything have no need for\ndriven behavior of <em>any</em> kind.</p>         <p><sup>59</sup> 41. The miracle acknowledges all men as your brothers and mine. It is\na way of perceiving the universal mark of God in them. The\nspecialness of God’s Sons does <em>not</em> stem from exclusion but from\ninclusion. <em>All</em> my brothers are special. If they believe they are\ndeprived of anything, their perception becomes distorted. When this\noccurs, the whole family of God, or the Sonship, is impaired in its\nrelationships. Ultimately, every member of the family of God must\nreturn. The miracle calls him to return because it blesses and\nhonors him even though he may be absent in spirit.</p>         <p><sup>60</sup> “God is not mocked” is not a warning but a reassurance on this point.\nGod <em>would</em> be mocked if any of His creations lacked holiness. The\ncreation <em>is</em> whole, and the mark of wholeness is holiness.</p>         <p><sup>61</sup> 42. Wholeness is the perceptual content of miracles. It thus corrects\nor atones for the faulty perception of lack anywhere.</p>         <p><sup>62</sup> Here we begin to make the fundamental distinction between miracles\nand projection. The stimulus <em>must</em> precede the response and will also\ndetermine the kind of response that is evoked. Behavior <em>is</em> response, so\nthat the question “response to what?” becomes crucial. Since stimuli are\nidentified through perception, you first perceive the stimulus and then\nbehave accordingly. It follows, then, that:</p>         <p><sup>63</sup> <em>As ye perceive,<br />So shall ye behave.</em></p>         <p><sup>64</sup> The Golden Rule asks you to behave toward others as you would have\nthem behave toward you. This means that the perception of both <em>must</em> be\naccurate. The Golden Rule is the rule for appropriate behavior. You\ncannot behave appropriately unless you perceive accurately, because\nappropriate behavior <em>depends</em> on lack of level confusion. The presence of\nlevel confusion <em>always</em> results in variable reality testing and therefore\nin variability in behavioral appropriateness. Since you and your\nneighbor are equal members of the same family, as you perceive both, so\nyou will behave toward both. The way to perceive for Golden Rule\nbehavior is to look out from the perception of your <em>own</em> holiness and\nperceive the holiness of others.</p>         <p><sup>65</sup> The emptiness engendered by fear should be replaced by love, because\nlove and its absence are in the same dimension, and correction cannot be\nundertaken except <em>within</em> a dimension. Otherwise, there has been a\nconfusion of levels. Death is a human affirmation of a belief in\n“[hate],” or level confusion. That is why the Bible says, “There <em>is</em> no\ndeath” and why I demonstrated that death does not exist. I came to\nfulfill the law by <em>reinterpreting</em> it. The law itself, if properly\nunderstood, offers only protection to man. It is those who have not yet\n“changed their minds” who entered the “hellfire” concept into it.</p>         <p><sup>66</sup> I assure you that <em>I</em> will witness for anyone who lets me and to\nwhatever extent he permits it. <em>Your</em> witnessing demonstrates <em>your</em> belief\nand thus strengthens it. Those who witness for me are expressing through\ntheir miracles that they have abandoned the belief in deprivation in\nfavor of the abundance they have learned <em>belongs</em> to them.</p>         <p><sup>67</sup> 43. A <em>major</em> contribution of miracles is their strength in releasing\nman from his misplaced sense of isolation, deprivation, and lack.</p>         <p><sup>68</sup> Miracles are affirmations of Sonship, which is a state of completion\nand abundance. Whatever is true and real is eternal and <em>cannot</em> change or\n<em>be</em> changed. The Soul is therefore unalterable because it is <em>already</em>\nperfect, but the mind can elect the level it chooses to serve. The <em>only</em>\nlimit which is put on its choice is that it <em>cannot</em> serve two masters.</p>         <p><sup>69</sup> The mind, if it elects to do so, becomes a medium by which the Soul\ncreates along the line of its own creation. If it does not freely elect\nto do so, it retains its creative <em>potential</em> but places itself under\ntyrannous rather than genuinely authoritative control. As a result it\nimprisons, because such are the dictates of tyrants. To change your mind\nmeans to place it at the disposal of <em>true</em> Authority.</p>         <p><sup>70</sup> The miracle is thus a sign that the mind has chosen to be led by\nChrist in His service. The abundance of Christ is the natural result of\nchoosing to follow Him. <em>All</em> shallow roots must be uprooted because they\nare not deep enough to sustain you. The illusion that shallow roots can\nbe <em>deepened</em> and thus made to hold is one of the distortions on which the\n<em>reversal</em> of the Golden Rule rests. As these false underpinnings are\ngiven up, the equilibrium is temporarily experienced as unstable.\nHowever, the fact is that <em>nothing</em> is less stable than an orientation\nthat is upside down. Nor can anything which holds it that way be really\nconducive to greater stability.</p>         <p><sup>71</sup> 44. Miracles arise from a miraculous state of mind. By being one,\nthis state of mind goes out to <em>anyone</em>, even without the awareness of\nthe miracle worker himself. The impersonal nature of miracles is\nbecause the Atonement itself is one, uniting all creations with\ntheir Creator.</p>         <p><sup>72</sup> 45. The miracle is an expression of an inner awareness of Christ and\nthe acceptance of His Atonement. The mind is then in a state of\ngrace and naturally becomes gracious both to the host within and the\nstranger without. By bringing in the stranger, he becomes your\nbrother.</p>         <p><sup>73</sup> 46. A miracle is never lost. It touches many people you do not even\nknow and sometimes produces undreamed of changes in forces of which\nyou are not even aware. That is not your concern. The miracle will\nalways bless <em>you</em>.</p>         <p><sup>74</sup> The miracles you are <em>not</em> asked to perform have not lost their value.\nThey are still expressions of your own state of grace, but the <em>action</em>\naspect of the miracle should be Christ-controlled because of His\ncomplete awareness of the whole plan. The impersonal nature of\nmiracle-mindedness ensures <em>your</em> grace, but only Christ is in a position\nto know where grace can be <em>bestowed</em>.</p>         <p><sup>75</sup> 47. Miracle-mindedness means miracle-readiness. Readiness means that\nyou should always keep your perceptions straight, so that you will\n<em>always</em> be ready, willing, and able. These are the essentials for\n“listen, learn, and do.” You must be <em>ready</em> to listen, <em>willing</em> to\nlearn, and <em>able</em> to do. Only the last is involuntary because it is\nthe <em>application</em> of miracles, which must be Christ-controlled. The\nother two, which are the <em>voluntary</em> aspects of miracle-mindedness,\n<em>are</em> up to you.</p>         <p><sup>76</sup> 48. Awe is an inappropriate response to miracles.</p>         <p><sup>77</sup> Revelation is literally unspeakable because it is an experience of\nunspeakable love. Awe should be reserved for revelation, to which it is\nperfectly and correctly applicable. It is <em>not</em> appropriate for miracles,\nbecause a state of awe is worshipful. It implies that one of a lesser\norder stands before a greater one. This is the case <em>only</em> when a Soul\nstands before its Creator. Souls are perfect creations and experience\nawe only in the Presence of the Creator of perfection.</p>         <p><sup>78</sup> The miracle, on the other hand, is a sign of love among equals.\nEquals cannot be in awe of one another because awe implies\ninequality.  It is therefore an inappropriate reaction to me. An\nelder brother is entitled to respect for his greater experience and\na reasonable amount of obedience for his greater wisdom. He is also\nentitled to love because he <em>is</em> a brother and also to devotion if he\nis devoted. It is only my devotion that entitles me to yours. There\nis nothing about me that <em>you</em> cannot attain. I have nothing that does\nnot come from God. The main difference between us as yet is that I\nhave <em>nothing</em> else. This leaves me in a state of true holiness, which\nis only a <em>potential</em> in you.</p>         <p><sup>79</sup> “No man cometh unto the Father but by me” is among the most\nmisunderstood statements in the Bible. It does <em>not</em> mean that I am in any\nway separate or different from you <em>except in time</em>, which does not really\nexist at all. Actually, the quotation is more meaningful if it is\nconsidered on a vertical rather than a horizontal axis. Regarded along\nthe vertical, man stands below me and I stand below God. In the process\nof “rising up,” I <em>am</em> higher. This is because, without me, the distance\nbetween God and man would be too great for you to encompass.</p>         <p><sup>80</sup> I bridge the distance as an elder brother to man on the one hand and\nas a Son of God on the other. My devotion to my brothers has placed me\nin charge of the Sonship, which I can render complete only to the extent\nto which I can <em>share</em> it. This may appear to contradict the statement, “I\nand my Father are one,” but there are still separate parts in the\nstatement in recognition that the Father is greater. (The original\nstatement was “are of one kind”). The Holy Spirit is the bringer of\nrevelations. Revelations are <em>indirectly</em> inspired by me because I am\nclose to the Holy Spirit and alert to the revelation-readiness of my\nbrothers. I can thus <em>bring</em> down to them more than they can <em>draw</em> down to\nthemselves.</p>         <p><sup>81</sup> 49. The Holy Spirit is the highest communication medium. Miracles do\nnot involve this type of communication, because they are <em>temporary</em>\ncommunication devices. When man returns to his original form of\ncommunication with God, the need for miracles is over. The Holy\nSpirit mediates higher to lower communication, keeping the direct\nchannel from God to man open for revelation. Revelation is not\nreciprocal. It is always <em>from</em> God <em>to</em> man. The miracle <em>is</em> reciprocal\nbecause it involves equality.</p>         <p><sup>82</sup> 50. The miracle is a learning device which lessens the need for time.\nIn the longitudinal or horizontal plane, the recognition of the true\nequality of all the members of the Sonship appears to involve almost\nendless time. However, the sudden shift from horizontal to vertical\nperception which the miracle entails introduces an interval from\nwhich the doer and the receiver both emerge much farther along in\ntime than they would otherwise have been.</p>         <p><sup>83</sup> The miracle thus has the unique property of shortening time by\nrendering the space of time it occupies unnecessary. There is <em>no</em>\nrelationship between the time a miracle <em>takes</em> and the time it\n<em>covers</em>. It substitutes for learning that might have taken thousands\nof years. It does this by the underlying recognition of perfect\nequality and holiness between the doer and the receiver on which the\nmiracle rests.</p>         <p><sup>84</sup> We said before that the miracle abolishes time. It does this by a\nprocess of <em>collapsing</em> it and thus abolishing certain <em>intervals</em> within\nit. It does this, however, <em>within</em> the larger temporal sequence. It\nestablishes an out-of-pattern time interval which is <em>not</em> under the usual\nlaws of time. Only in this sense is it timeless. By collapsing time, it\nliterally saves time. Much as daylight saving time does, it rearranges\nthe distribution of light.</p>         <p><sup>85</sup> 51. The miracle is the only device which man has at his immediate\ndisposal for controlling time. Only revelation <em>transcends</em> time,\nhaving nothing to do with time at all.</p>         <p><sup>86</sup> The miracle is much like the body in that both are learning aids\nwhich aim at facilitating a state in which they are unnecessary. When\nthe Soul’s original state of direct communication is reached, neither\nthe body nor the miracle serves any purpose. While he believes he is in\na body, however, man can choose between loveless and miraculous channels\nof expression. He can make an empty shell, but he <em>cannot</em> express nothing\nat all. He can wait, delay, paralyze himself, reduce his creativity to\nalmost nothing, and even introduce a developmental arrest or even a\nregression. But he <em>cannot</em> abolish his creativity. He can destroy his\nmedium of communication but <em>not</em> his potential.</p>         <p><sup>87</sup> Man was <em>not</em> created by his own free will alone. Only what <em>he</em> creates\nis his to decide. The basic decision of the miracle-minded is not to\nwait on time any longer than is necessary. Time can waste as well as be\nwasted. The miracle-worker, therefore, accepts the time-control factor\ngladly because he recognizes that every collapse of time brings all men\ncloser to the ultimate <em>release</em> from time in which the Son and the Father\n<em>are</em> one.</p>         <p><sup>88</sup> Equality does not imply homogeneity <em>now</em>. When everyone recognizes\nthat he has everything, individual contributions to the Sonship will no\nlonger be necessary. When the Atonement has been completed, <em>all</em> talents\nwill be shared by <em>all</em> the Sons of God. God is <em>not</em> partial. All His\nChildren have His total love, and <em>all</em> His gifts are freely given to\neveryone alike. “Except ye become as little children” means that, unless\nyou fully recognize your complete dependence on God, you cannot know the\nreal power of the Son in his true relationship with the Father.</p>         <p><sup>89</sup> You who want peace can find it only by complete forgiveness. You\nnever really <em>wanted</em> peace before, so there was no point in being\ntold how to achieve it. No learning is acquired by anyone unless he\nwants to learn it and believes in some way that he <em>needs</em> it. While\nthe concept of lack does not exist in the creation of God, it is\n<em>very</em> apparent in the creations of man. It is, in fact, the essential\ndifference. A need implies lack by definition. It involves the\nrecognition that you would be better off in a state which is somehow\ndifferent from the one you are in.</p>         <p><sup>90</sup> Until the “separation,” which is a better term than the “fall,”\nnothing was lacking. This meant that man had no needs at all. If he had\nnot deprived himself, he would never have experienced them. After the\nseparation, needs became the most powerful source of motivation for\nhuman action. All behavior is essentially motivated by needs, but\nbehavior itself is not a divine attribute. The body is the mechanism for\nbehavior. The belief that he <em>could</em> be better off is the reason why man\nhas this mechanism at his disposal.</p>         <p><sup>91</sup> Each one acts according to the particular hierarchy of needs he\nestablishes for himself. His hierarchy, in turn, depends on his\nperception of what he <em>is</em>—that is, what he <em>lacks</em>. A sense of separation\nfrom God is the only <em>lack</em> he really needs to correct. This sense of\nseparation would never have occurred if he had not distorted his\nperception of truth and thus perceived <em>himself</em> as lacking. The concept\nof <em>any</em> sort of need hierarchy arose because, having made this\nfundamental error, he had already fragmented himself into levels with\ndifferent needs. As he integrates <em>he</em> becomes one, and his needs become\none accordingly.</p>         <p><sup>92</sup> Unified need produces unified action, because it produces a lack of\nambivalence. The concept of a need hierarchy, a corollary to the\noriginal error that man can be separated from God, requires correction\nat its own level before the error of perceiving levels at all can be\ncorrected. Man cannot behave effectively while he operates at split\nlevels. However, while he does, correction must be introduced from the\nbottom <em>up</em>. This is because he now operates in space, where concepts such\nas “up” and “down” are meaningful. Ultimately, space is as meaningless\nas time. The concept is really one of space-time <em>belief</em>.</p>         <p><sup>93</sup> The physical world exists only because man can use it to correct his\n<em>unbelief</em>, which placed him in it originally. He can never control the\neffects of fear himself because he <em>made</em> fear and believes in what he\nmade. In attitude, then, though <em>not</em> in content, he resembles his own\nCreator, Who has perfect faith in His creations <em>because</em> He created them.\nBelief in a creation produces its existence. That is why a man can\nbelieve in what no one else thinks is true. It is true for him because\nit was made <em>by</em> him.</p>         <p><sup>94</sup> Every aspect of fear proceeds from upside-down perception. The\nmore truly creative devote their efforts to correcting perceptual\ndistortions. The neurotic devotes his to compromise. The psychotic\ntries to escape by establishing the certain truth of his own errors.\nIt is most difficult to free him by ordinary means because he is\nmore consistent in his own denial of truth. The miracle, however,\nmakes no such distinctions. It corrects errors because they are\nerrors. Thus, the next point to remember about miracles is:</p>         <p><sup>95</sup> 52. The miracle makes no distinction among degrees of misperception.\nIt is a device for perception-correction, effective quite apart from\neither the degree or the direction of the error. This is its <em>true</em>\nindiscriminateness.</p>         <p><sup>96</sup> Christ-controlled miracles are selective <em>only</em> in the sense that they\nare directed towards those who can use them for <em>themselves</em>. Since this\nmakes it inevitable that they will extend them to others, a strong chain\nof Atonement is welded. However, Christ-control takes no account at all\nof the magnitude of the miracle itself because the concept of size\nexists in a plane that is itself unreal. Since the miracle aims at\n<em>restoring</em> the awareness of reality, it would hardly be useful if it were\nbound by the laws which govern the error it aims to correct. Only man\nmakes this kind of mistake. It is an example of the foolish consistency\nwhich his own false beliefs have engendered.</p>         <p><sup>97</sup> The power and strength of man’s creative will must be understood\nbefore the real meaning of denial can be appreciated and relinquished.\nIt is <em>not</em> mere negation. It is a positive miscreation. While the\nmiscreation is <em>necessarily</em> believed in by its maker, it does not exist\nat all at the level of true creation.</p>         <p><sup>98</sup> 53. The miracle compares what man has made with the higher level\ncreation, accepting what is <em>in accord</em> as true and rejecting the\n<em>discordant</em> as false. <em>All</em> aspects of fear are untrue because they do\nnot exist at the higher creative level, and therefore do not exist\nat all. To whatever extent a man is willing to submit his beliefs to\nthis test, to that extent are perceptions corrected.</p>         <p><sup>99</sup> In sorting out the false from the true, the miracle proceeds along\nthe following lines:</p>         <p><sup>100</sup> <em>If perfect love casts out fear,<br />And if fear\nexists,<br />Then there is <strong>not</strong> perfect love.<br />But only perfect\nlove <strong>really</strong> exists.<br />If there <strong>is</strong> fear,<br />It creates a\nstate which does not exist.</em></p>         <p><sup>101</sup> Believe this and you <em>will</em> be free. Only God can establish this\nsolution, and <em>this</em> faith <em>is</em> His gift.</p>",

    "content": "<p><sup>102</sup> You are involved in unconscious distortions which are producing a\ndense cover over miracle impulses and which make it hard for them to\nreach consciousness. The nature of any interpersonal relationship is\nlimited or defined by what you want it to <em>do</em>. Relating is a way of\nachieving an outcome. The danger of defenses lies in their propensity\nfor holding misperceptions rigidly in place. All actions which stem from\nreverse thinking are literally the behavioral expressions of those who\nknow not what they do. A rigid orientation can be extremely reliable,\neven if it is upside-down. In fact, the more consistently upside-down it\nis, the <em>more</em> reliable it is.</p>\n\n<p><sup>103</sup> However, validity is still the ultimate goal, which reliability can\nonly serve. Hostility, triumph, vengeance, self-debasement, and all\nkinds of expressions of lack of love are often very clearly seen in the\nfantasies which accompany them. But it is a <em>profound</em> error to imagine\nthat because these fantasies are so frequent or occur so reliably that\nthis implies validity. Remember that while validity implies reliability,\nthe relationship is <em>not</em> reversible. You can be wholly reliable and\n<em>entirely</em> wrong. While a reliable instrument <em>does</em> measure something, what\n<em>use</em> is it unless you discover what the “something” is? This course,\nthen, will concentrate on validity and let reliability fall naturally\ninto place.</p>\n\n<p><sup>104</sup> The confusion of miracle impulses with physical impulses is a major\nsource of perceptual distortion because it <em>induces</em>, rather than\nstraightens out, the basic level confusion which underlies the\nperception of all those who seek happiness with the instruments of this\nworld. Inappropriate physical impulses (or misdirected miracle impulses)\nresult in conscious guilt if expressed and depression if denied. <em>All</em>\nreal pleasure comes from doing God’s Will. This is because <em>not</em> doing it\nis a denial of self. <em>Denial</em> of error results in projection. <em>Correction</em>\nof error brings release. “Lead us not into temptation” means “do not let\nus deceive ourselves into believing that we can relate in peace to God\nor to our brothers with <em>anything</em> external.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>105</sup> Child of God, you were created to create the good, the beautiful,\nand the holy. Do not lose sight of this. The love of God for a little\nwhile must still be expressed through one body to another, because the\nreal vision is still so dim. Everyone can use his body best by enlarging\nman’s perception so he can see the <em>real</em> vision. <em>This</em> vision is\ninvisible to the physical eye. The ultimate purpose of the body is to\nrender itself unnecessary.  Learning to do this is the only real reason\nfor its creation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>106</sup> Fantasies of any kind are distorted forms of thinking, because they\n<em>always</em> involve twisting perception into unreality. Fantasy is a debased\nform of vision. Vision and revelation are closely related, while fantasy\nand projection are more closely associated, because both attempt to\ncontrol external reality according to false internal needs.  Twist\nreality in <em>any</em> way, and you are perceiving destructively. Reality was\nlost through usurpation, which in turn produced tyranny. I told you that\nyou are now restored to your former role in the plan of Atonement, but\nyou must still choose freely to devote yourselves to the greater\nrestoration. As long as a single slave remains to walk the earth, your\nrelease is not complete. <em>Complete</em> restoration of the Sonship is the only\ntrue goal of the miracle-minded.</p>\n\n<p><sup>107</sup> No fantasies are true. They are distortions of perception by\ndefinition. They are a means of making false associations and obtaining\npleasure from them. Man can do this only because he is creative. But,\nalthough he can perceive false associations, he can never make them real\n<em>except to himself</em>. Man believes in what he creates. If he creates\nmiracles, he will be equally strong in his belief in <em>them</em>. The strength\nof <em>his</em> conviction will then sustain the belief of the miracle receiver.\nAnd fantasies become totally unnecessary as the wholly satisfying nature\nof reality becomes apparent to both.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>This section deals with a fundamental misuse of knowledge, referred to\nin the Bible as the cause of the “fall,” or separation. There are some\ndefinitions which I asked you to take from the dictionary which will be\nhelpful here. They are somewhat unusual since they are not the first\ndefinitions which are given. Nevertheless, the fact that each of them\ndoes appear in the dictionary should be reassuring.</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Project</em> (verb): to extend forward or out.<br /><em>Project</em> (noun): a plan in\nthe mind.<br /><em>World</em>: a natural grand division.</p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup> We will refer later to projection as related to both mental health and\nmental illness. We have already observed that man can create an empty\nshell, but he cannot create nothing at all. This emptiness provides the\nscreen for the misuse of projection.</p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup> The Garden of Eden, which is described as a literal garden in the\nBible, was not an actual garden at all. It was merely a mental state of\ncomplete need-lack. Even in the literal account, it is noteworthy that\nthe pre-separation state was essentially one in which man needed\nnothing. The “tree of knowledge” is also an overly literal figure. These\nconcepts need to be clarified before the real meaning of the separation,\nor the “detour into fear,” can be fully understood.</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> To “project,” as defined above, is a fundamental attribute of God\nwhich He gave to His Son. In the creation, God projected His creative\nability from Himself to the Souls He created, and He also imbued them\nwith the same loving will to create. The Soul has not only been fully\ncreated but has also been created perfect. There is <em>no</em> emptiness in it.\nBecause of its likeness to its Creator, it is creative. No Child of God\ncan lose this ability because it is inherent in what he <em>is</em>, but he <em>can</em>\nuse it inappropriately. Whenever projection is used inappropriately, it\n<em>always</em> implies that some emptiness or lack exists and that it is in\nman’s ability to put his <em>own</em> ideas there <em>instead</em> of truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> If you consider carefully what this entails, the following will become\nquite apparent:</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> First, the assumption is implicit that what God created can be <em>changed</em>\nby the mind of man.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> Second, the concept that what is perfect can be rendered imperfect or\nwanting is accepted.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> Third, the belief that man can distort the creations of God, <em>including\nhimself</em>, is accepted.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> Fourth, the idea that since man can create himself, the direction of\nhis own creation is up to <em>him</em> is implied.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> These related distortions represent a picture of what actually\noccurred in the separation. None of this existed before, nor does it\nactually exist now. The world <em>was</em> made as “a natural grand division,” or\na projecting outward of God. That is why everything that He created is\nlike Him. Projection, as undertaken by God, is very similar to the kind\nof inner radiance which the Children of the Father inherit from Him. It\nis important to note that the term “project outward” necessarily implies\nthat the <em>real</em> source of projection is internal. This is as true of the\nSon as of the Father.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> The world, in the original connotation of the term, included both the\nproper creation of man by God <em>and</em> the proper creation by man in his\nright mind. The latter required the endowment of man by God with free\nwill because <em>all</em> loving creation is freely given. Nothing in these\nstatements implies any sort of level involvement or in fact anything\nexcept one continuous line of creation in which all aspects are of the\nsame order.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> When the “lies of the serpent” were introduced, they were\nspecifically called “lies” because they are not true. When man listened,\nall he heard was untruth. He does not have to continue to believe what\nis not true unless he chooses to do so. All of his miscreations can\nliterally disappear in “the twinkling of an eye” because they are merely\nvisual misperceptions. Man’s Spiritual eye can sleep, but a sleeping eye\ncan still see. What is seen in dreams seems to be very real. The Bible\nmentions that “a deep sleep fell upon Adam,” and nowhere is there any\nreference to his waking up.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> The history of man in the world as he sees it has not yet been marked\nby any genuine or comprehensive reawakening or rebirth. This is\nimpossible as long as man projects in the spirit of miscreation. It\nstill remains within him, however, to project as God projected His own\nSpirit to him. In reality, this is his <em>only</em> choice, because his free\nwill was given him for his own joy in creating the perfect.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> All fear is ultimately reducible to the basic misperception that man\nhas the ability to <em>usurp</em> the power of God. It can only be emphasized\nthat he neither <em>can</em> nor <em>has been</em> able to do this. In this fact lies the\nreal justification for his escape from fear. The escape is brought about\nby his acceptance of the Atonement, which places him in a position to\nrealize that his own errors never really occurred. When the “deep sleep”\nfell upon Adam, he was in a condition to experience nightmares <em>because</em>\nhe was asleep. If a light is suddenly turned on while someone is\ndreaming a fearful dream, he may initially interpret the light itself as\na part of his own dream and be afraid of it. However, when he awakens\nthe light is correctly perceived as the release <em>from</em> the dream, which is\nno longer accorded reality.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> It is quite apparent that this release does <em>not</em> depend on the kind of\n“knowledge” which is nothing more than deceiving lies. The knowledge\nwhich illuminates rather than obscures is the knowledge which not only\n<em>sets</em> you free, but which also shows you clearly that you <em>are</em> free.\nWhatever lies you may believe are of no concern to the miracle, which\ncan heal <em>any</em> of them with equal ease. It makes <em>no</em> distinctions among\nmisperceptions. Its <em>sole</em> concern is to distinguish between truth on the\none hand and <em>all</em> kinds of errors on the other. Some miracles may <em>seem</em> to\nbe of greater magnitude than others. But remember the first point in\nthis course—that there is <em>no</em> order of difficulty in miracles.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> In reality, you are perfectly unaffected by all expressions of lack\nof love. These can be either from yourself and others or from yourself\n<em>to</em> others or from others to <em>you</em>. Peace is an attribute in <em>you</em>. You\ncannot find it outside. All mental illness is some form of external\nsearching. Mental health is <em>inner</em> peace. It enables you to remain\nunshaken by lack of love from without and capable through your own\nmiracles of correcting the external conditions which proceed from lack\nof love in others.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>18</sup> When you are afraid of <em>anything</em>, you are acknowledging its power to\nhurt you. Remember that where your heart is, there is your treasure\nalso. This means that you believe in what you <em>value</em>. If you are afraid,\nyou are <em>valuing wrongly</em>. Human understanding will inevitably value\nwrongly and, by endowing all human thoughts with equal power, will\ninevitably <em>destroy</em> peace. That is why the Bible speaks of “the peace of\nGod which <em>passeth</em> (human) understanding.” <em>This</em> peace is totally\nincapable of being shaken by human errors of <em>any</em> kind. It denies the\nability of <em>anything</em> which is not of God to affect you in <em>any</em> way.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> This is the <em>proper</em> use of denial. It is not used to <em>hide</em> anything but\nto <em>correct</em> error. It brings <em>all</em> error into the light, and since error\nand darkness are the same, it corrects error automatically. True denial\nis a powerful protective device. You can and should deny any belief that\nerror can hurt you. This kind of denial is not a concealment device but\na correction device. The “right mind” of the mentally healthy <em>depends</em> on\nit. You can do <em>anything</em> I ask. I have asked you to perform miracles and\nhave made it clear that miracles are <em>natural, corrective, healing, and\nuniversal</em>. There is nothing good they cannot do, but they cannot be\nperformed in the spirit of doubt.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> God and the Souls He created are <em>completely</em> dependent on each other.\nThe creation of the Soul has already been perfectly accomplished, but\nthe creation <em>by</em> Souls has not. God created Souls so He could depend on\nthem <em>because</em> He created them perfectly. He gave them His peace so they\ncould not be shaken and would be unable to be deceived. Whenever you are\nafraid, you are deceived. Your mind is <em>not</em> serving the Soul. This\nliterally starves the Soul by denying its daily bread. God offers <em>only</em>\nmercy. <em>Your</em> words should reflect only mercy because that is what you\nhave received, and that is what you should <em>give</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> Justice is a temporary expedient or an attempt to teach man the\nmeaning of mercy. Its judgmental side arises only because man is capable\nof <em>in</em>justice if that is what his mind creates. You are afraid of God’s\nWill because you have used your own will, which He created in the\nlikeness of His own, to <em>miscreate</em>. What you do <em>not</em> realize is that the\nmind can miscreate <em>only</em> when it is <em>not</em> free. An imprisoned mind is not\nfree by definition. It is possessed or held back by itself. Its will is\ntherefore limited and is not free to assert <em>itself</em>. The real meaning of\n“are of one kind,” which was mentioned before, is “are of one mind or\nwill.” When the will of the Sonship and the Father are one, their\nperfect accord <em>is</em> Heaven.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> Denial of error is a powerful defense of truth. You will note that we\nhave been shifting the emphasis from the negative to the positive use of\ndenial. As we have already stated, denial is not a purely negative\ndevice; it results in positive miscreation. That is the way the mentally\nill <em>do</em> employ it. But remember a very early thought of your own—“Never\nunderestimate the power of denial.” In the service of the “right mind,”\nthe denial of <em>error</em> frees the mind and reestablishes the freedom of the\nwill. When the will is <em>really</em> free, it <em>cannot</em> miscreate because it\nrecognizes <em>only</em> truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> False projection arises out of false denial, <em>not</em> out of its proper\nuse. My own role in the Atonement is one of <em>true</em> projection; I can\nproject to <em>you</em> the affirmation of truth. If you project error to me or\nto yourself, you are interfering with the process. <em>My</em> use of projection,\nwhich can also be yours, is <em>not</em> based on faulty denial. It <em>does</em> involve,\nhowever, the very powerful use of the denial of errors. The miracle\nworker is one who accepts my kind of denial and projection, unites his\nown inherent abilities to deny and project with mine, and imposes them\nback on himself and others. This establishes the total <em>lack</em> of threat\nanywhere. Together we can then work for the real time of peace, which is\neternal.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> The improper use of defenses is quite widely recognized, but their\nproper use had not been sufficiently understood as yet. They can <em>indeed</em>\ncreate man’s perception both of himself and of the world. They can\ndistort or correct depending on what you use them <em>for</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> Denial should be directed only to error, and projection should be\nreserved only for truth. You should truly give as you have truly\nreceived. The Golden Rule can work effectively only on this basis.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> Intellectualization is a term which stems from the mind-brain\nconfusion. “Right-mindedness” is the device which defends the <em>right</em> mind\nand gives it control over the body. “Intellectualization” implies a\nsplit, while “right-mindedness” involves healing.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> Withdrawal is properly employed in the service of withdrawing from\nthe meaningless. It is <em>not</em> a device for escape, but for consolidation.\nThere <em>is</em> only One Mind.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> Dissociation is quite similar. You <em>should</em> split off or dissociate\nyourself from error but only in defense of integration.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> Detachment is essentially a weaker form of dissociation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> Flight can be undertaken in whatever direction you choose, but note\nthat the concept itself implies flight <em>from</em> something. Flight from error\nis perfectly appropriate.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> Distantiation can be properly used as a way of putting distance\nbetween yourself and what you <em>should</em> fly from.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> Regression is an effort to return to your own original state. It can\nthus be utilized to <em>restore</em>, rather than to go back to the <em>less</em> mature.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> Sublimation should be a redirection of effort to the sublime.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> There are many other so-called “dynamic” concepts which are profound\nerrors due essentially to the misuse of defenses. Among them is the\nconcept of different levels of aspiration, which actually result from\nlevel confusion. However, the main point to be understood from this\nsection is that you can defend truth as well as error and, in fact, much\nbetter.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> The means are easier to clarify after the value of the goal itself is\nfirmly established. Everyone defends his own treasure. You do not have\nto tell him to do so because he will do it automatically. The real\nquestions still remain. <em>What</em> do you treasure, and <em>how much</em> do you\ntreasure it? Once you have learned to consider these two questions and\nto bring them into <em>all</em> your actions as the true criteria for behavior, I\nwill have little difficulty in clarifying the means. You have not\nlearned to be consistent about this as yet. I have therefore\nconcentrated on showing you that the means <em>are</em> available whenever you\n<em>ask</em>. You can, however, save a lot of time if you do not extend this step\nunduly. The correct focus will shorten it immeasurably.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> The Atonement is the <em>only</em> defense which cannot be used destructively.\nThat is because, while everyone must eventually join it, it is <em>not</em> a\ndevice which was generated by man. The Atonement <em>principle</em> was in effect\nlong before the Atonement itself began. The principle was love, and the\nAtonement itself was an <em>act</em> of love. Acts were not necessary before the\nseparation because the time-space belief did not exist. It was only\nafter the separation that the defense of Atonement and the necessary\nconditions for its fulfillment were planned.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> It became increasingly apparent that all of the defenses which man\ncan choose to use constructively <em>or</em> destructively were not enough to\nsave him. It was therefore decided that he needed a defense which was so\nsplendid that he could not misuse it, although he <em>could</em> refuse it. His\nchoice could not, however, turn it into a weapon of attack, which is the\ninherent characteristic of all other defenses. The Atonement thus\nbecomes the <em>only</em> defense which is <em>not</em> a two-edged sword.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> The Atonement actually began long before the crucifixion. Many Souls\noffered their efforts on behalf of the separated ones, but they could\nnot withstand the strength of the attack and had to be brought back.\nAngels came, too, but their protection did not suffice because the\nseparated ones were not interested in peace. They had already split\ntheir minds and were bent on further dividing rather than reintegrating.\nThe levels they introduced into their minds turned against each other,\nand they established differences, divisions, cleavages, dispersions, and\nall the other concepts related to the increasing splits which they\nproduced.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> Not being in their right minds, they turned their defenses from\nprotection to assault and acted literally insanely. It was essential to\nintroduce a split-proof device which could be used <em>only</em> to heal, if it\nwere used at all. The Atonement was built into the space-time belief in\norder to set a limit on the need for the belief and ultimately to make\nlearning complete. The Atonement <em>is</em> the final lesson. Learning itself,\nlike the classrooms in which it occurs, is temporary. The ability to\nlearn has no value when change of understanding is no longer necessary.\nThe eternally creative have nothing to learn. Only after the separation\nwas it necessary to direct the creative forces to learning because\nchanged behavior had become mandatory.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> Men can learn to improve their behavior and can also learn to become\nbetter and better learners. This serves to bring them into closer and\ncloser accord with the Sonship, but the Sonship itself is a perfect\ncreation, and perfection is <em>not</em> a matter of degree. Only while there are\ndifferent degrees is learning meaningful. The “evolution” of man is\nmerely a process by which he proceeds from one degree to the next. He\ncorrects his previous missteps by stepping forward. This represents a\nprocess which is actually incomprehensible in temporal terms because he\n<em>returns</em> as he goes forward.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> The Atonement is the device by which he can free himself from the\npast as he goes ahead. It <em>undoes</em> his past errors, thus making it\nunnecessary for him to keep retracing his steps without advancing to his\nreturn. In this sense the Atonement saves time but, like the miracle\nwhich serves it, does <em>not</em> abolish it. As long as there is need for\nAtonement, there is need for time. But the Atonement as a completed plan\ndoes have a unique relationship <em>to</em> time. Until the Atonement is\nfinished, its various phases will proceed <em>in</em> time, but the whole\nAtonement stands at time’s end. At this point, the bridge of the return\nhas been built.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> The Atonement is a <em>total</em> commitment. You still think this is\nassociated with loss. This is the same mistake <em>all</em> the separated ones\nmake in one way or another. They cannot believe that a defense which\ncannot attack <em>is</em> the best defense. This is what is meant by “the meek\nshall inherit the earth.” They will literally take it over because of\ntheir strength. A two-way defense is inherently weak precisely <em>because</em>\nit has two edges and can turn against the self very unexpectedly. This\ntendency cannot be controlled <em>except</em> by miracles.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> The miracle turns the defense of Atonement to the protection of the\ninner self, which, as it becomes more and more secure, assumes its\nnatural talent of protecting others. The inner self knows itself as both\na brother <em>and</em> a Son. You know that when defenses are disrupted, there is\na period of real disorientation accompanied by fear, guilt, and usually\nvacillations between anxiety and depression. This course is different in\nthat defenses are <em>not</em> being disrupted but <em>reinterpreted</em>, even though you\nmay experience it as the same thing. In the reinterpretation of\ndefenses, only their use for <em>attack</em> is lost. Since this means they can\nbe used only <em>one</em> way, they become much stronger and much more\ndependable. They no longer oppose the Atonement but greatly facilitate\nit.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> The Atonement can only be accepted <em>within</em> you. You have perceived it\nlargely as <em>external</em> thus far, and that is why your experience of it has\nbeen minimal. The reinterpretation of defenses is essential in releasing\nthe <em>inner</em> light. Since the separation, man’s defenses have been used\nalmost entirely to defend himself <em>against</em> the Atonement and thus\nmaintain the separation. They themselves generally see this as a need to\n<em>protect</em> the body. The many body fantasies with which men’s minds are\nengaged arise from the distorted belief that the body can be used as a\nmeans for attaining “atonement.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> Perceiving the body as a temple is only the first step in correcting\nthis kind of distortion. It alters part of the misperception but not all\nof it. It <em>does</em> recognize, however, that the concept of Atonement in\nphysical terms is not appropriate. However, the next step is to realize\nthat a temple is not a building at all. Its <em>real</em> holiness lies in the\n<em>inner</em> altar around which the building is built. The inappropriate\nemphasis men have put on beautiful church buildings is a sign of their\n<em>fear</em> of Atonement and their unwillingness to reach the altar itself. The\n<em>real</em> beauty of the temple cannot be seen with the physical eye. The\nSpiritual eye, on the other hand, cannot see the building at all because\nit has perfect sight. It <em>can</em>, however, see the altar with <em>perfect</em>\nclarity.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> For perfect effectiveness, the Atonement belongs at the center of the\ninner altar, where it undoes the separation and restores the wholeness\nof the mind. Before the separation, the mind was invulnerable to fear\nbecause fear did not exist. Both the separation <em>and</em> the fear are\nmiscreations of the mind which must be undone. This is what is meant by\n“the restoration of the temple.” It does not mean the restoration of the\nbuilding but the opening of the altar to receive the Atonement. This\nheals the separation and places <em>within</em> man the one defense against <em>all</em>\nseparation mind-errors which can make him perfectly invulnerable.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> The acceptance of the Atonement by everyone is only a matter of time.\nIn fact, both time <em>and</em> matter were created for this purpose. This\nappears to contradict free will because of the inevitability of the\nfinal decision. If you review the idea carefully, however, you will\nrealize that this is not true. Everything is limited in some way by the\nmanner of its creation. Free will can temporize and is capable of\nenormous procrastination. But it cannot depart entirely from its\nCreator, Who set the limits on its ability to miscreate by virtue of its\nown <em>real</em> purpose.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> The misuse of will engenders a situation which in the extreme becomes\naltogether intolerable. Pain thresholds can be high, but they are not\nlimitless. Eventually everyone begins to recognize, however dimly, that\nthere <em>must</em> be a better way. As this recognition becomes more firmly\nestablished, it becomes a perceptual turning-point. This ultimately\nreawakens the Spiritual eye, simultaneously weakening the investment in\nphysical sight. The alternating investment in the two types or levels of\nperception is usually experienced as conflict for a long time and can\nbecome very acute, but the outcome is as certain as God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> The Spiritual eye literally <em>cannot see</em> error and merely looks for\nAtonement. All the solutions which the physical eyes seek dissolve in\nits sight. The Spiritual eye, which looks within, recognizes immediately\nthat the altar has been defiled and needs to be repaired and protected.\nPerfectly aware of the <em>right</em> defense, It passes over all others, looking\npast error to truth. Because of the real strength of <em>Its</em> vision, It\npulls the will into Its service and impels the mind to concur. This\nreestablishes the true power of the will and makes it increasingly\nunable to tolerate delay. The mind then realizes with increasing\ncertainty that delay is only a way of increasing unnecessary pain, which\nit need not tolerate at all. The pain threshold drops accordingly, and\nthe mind becomes increasingly sensitive to what it would once have\nregarded as very minor intrusions of discomfort.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> The Children of God are <em>entitled</em> to perfect comfort, which comes from\na sense of perfect trust. Until they achieve this, they waste themselves\nand their true creative powers on useless attempts to make themselves\nmore comfortable by inappropriate means. But the real means is <em>already</em>\nprovided and does not involve any effort at all on their part. Their\negocentricity usually misperceives this as personally insulting, an\ninterpretation which obviously arises from their misperception of\nthemselves. Egocentricity and communion <em>cannot</em> coexist. Even the terms\nare contradictory.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> The Atonement is the only gift that is worthy of being offered to the\naltar of God. This is because of the inestimable value of the altar\nitself. It was created perfect and is entirely worthy of receiving\nperfection. God <em>is</em> lonely without His Souls, and <em>they</em> are lonely without\nHim. Men must learn to perceive the world as a means of <em>healing</em> the\nseparation. The Atonement is the <em>guarantee</em> that they will ultimately\nsucceed.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>52</sup> The emphasis will now be on healing. The miracle is the means, the\nAtonement is the principle, and healing is the result. Those who speak\nof “a miracle of healing” are combining two orders of reality\ninappropriately. Healing is <em>not</em> a miracle. The Atonement or the final\nmiracle is a <em>remedy</em>, while any type of healing is a result. The <em>kind</em> of\nerror to which Atonement is applied is irrelevant. Essentially, <em>all</em>\nhealing is the release from fear. To undertake this, you <em>cannot</em> be\nfearful yourself. You do not understand healing because of your <em>own</em>\nfear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> A major step in the Atonement plan is to undo error at <em>all</em> levels.\nIllness, which is really “not-right-mindedness,” is the result of level\nconfusion in the sense that it always entails the belief that what is\namiss in one level can adversely affect another. We have constantly\nreferred to miracles as the means of correcting level confusion, and all\nmistakes must be corrected at the level on which they occur. Only the\n<em>mind</em> is capable of error. The body can <em>act</em> erroneously, but this is only\nbecause it is responding to mis-thought. The body cannot create, and the\nbelief that it <em>can</em>, a fundamental error, produces all physical symptoms.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> All physical illness represents a belief in magic. The whole\ndistortion which created magic rests on the belief that there is a\ncreative ability in matter which the mind cannot control. This error can\ntake two forms—it can be believed that the mind can miscreate <em>in</em> the\nbody or that the body can miscreate in the mind. If it is understood\nthat the mind, which is the <em>only</em> level of creation, cannot create beyond\nitself, neither type of confusion need occur.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> The reason only the mind can create is more obvious than may be\nimmediately apparent. The Soul <em>has been</em> created. The body is a learning\ndevice for the mind. Learning devices are not lessons in themselves.\nTheir purpose is merely to facilitate the thinking of the learner. The\nmost that a faulty use of a learning device can do is to fail to\nfacilitate learning. It has no power in itself to introduce actual\nlearning errors.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> The body, if properly understood, shares the invulnerability of the\nAtonement to two-edged application. This is not because the body is a\nmiracle but because it is not <em>inherently</em> open to misinterpretation. The\nbody is merely a fact in human experience. Its abilities can be and\nfrequently are over-evaluated. However, it is almost impossible to deny\nits existence. Those who do so are engaging in a particularly unworthy\nform of denial. The term “unworthy” here implies simply that it is not\nnecessary to protect the mind by denying the unmindful. [There is little\ndoubt that the mind can miscreate.] If one denies this unfortunate\naspect of the mind’s power, one is also denying the power itself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> All material means which man accepts as remedies for bodily ills are\nmerely restatements of magic principles. It was the first level of the\nerror to believe that the body created its own illness. It is a second\nmisstep to attempt to heal it through non-creative agents. It does not\nfollow, however, that the use of these very weak corrective devices is\nevil. Sometimes the illness has a sufficiently great hold over a mind to\nrender a person inaccessible to Atonement. In this case it may be wise\nto utilize a compromise approach to mind <em>and</em> body, in which something\nfrom the <em>outside</em> is temporarily given healing belief.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> This is because the <em>last</em> thing that can help the non-right-minded, or\nthe sick, is an <em>increase</em> in fear. They are already <em>in</em> a fear-weakened\nstate. If they are inappropriately exposed to an “undiluted” miracle,\nthey may be precipitated into panic. This is particularly likely to\noccur when upside-down perception has induced the belief that miracles\nare frightening.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> The value of the Atonement does not lie in the manner in which it is\nexpressed. In fact, if it is truly used, it will inevitably <em>be</em> expressed\nin whatever way is most helpful to the receiver[, not the giver]. This\nmeans that a miracle, to attain its full efficacy, <em>must</em> be expressed in\na language which the recipient can understand <em>without</em> fear. It does not\nfollow by any means that this is the highest level of communication of\nwhich he is capable. It <em>does</em> mean, however, that it is the highest level\nof communication of which he is capable <em>now</em>. The whole aim of the\nmiracle is to raise the level of communication, not to impose regression\nin the improper sense upon it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> Before miracle workers are ready to undertake their function in this\nworld, it is essential that they fully understand the <em>fear of release</em>.\nOtherwise, they may unwittingly foster the belief that release is\nimprisonment, a belief that is very prevalent. This misperception arose\nfrom the underlying misbelief that harm can be limited to the body. This\nwas because of the much greater fear that the mind can hurt itself.\nNeither error is really meaningful, because the miscreations of the mind\ndo not really exist. <em>This</em> recognition is a far better protective device\nthan <em>any</em> form of level confusion, because it introduces correction at\nthe level of the error.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> It is essential to remember that <em>only</em> the mind can create. Implicit\nin this is the corollary that correction belongs at the <em>thought</em> level.\nTo repeat an earlier statement and to extend it somewhat, the Soul is\nalready perfect and therefore does not require correction. The body does\nnot really exist except as a learning device for the mind. This learning\ndevice is <em>not</em> subject to errors of its own because it was created but is\n<em>not</em> creating. It should be obvious, then, that correcting the creator or\ninducing it to give up its miscreations is the only application of\ncreative ability which is truly meaningful.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> Magic is essentially mindless or the miscreative use of the mind.\nPhysical medications are forms of “spells.” Those who are <em>afraid</em> to use\nthe mind to heal should not attempt to do so. The very fact that they\n<em>are</em> afraid has made them vulnerable to miscreation. They are therefore\nlikely to misunderstand any healing they might induce and, because\negocentricity and fear usually occur together, may be unable to accept\nthe real Source of the healing. Under these conditions, it is safer for\nthem to rely <em>temporarily</em> on physical healing devices, because they\ncannot misperceive them as their own creations. As long as their sense\nof vulnerability persists, they should be preserved from even attempting\nmiracles.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> We have already said that the miracle is an expression of\nmiracle-mindedness. Miracle-mindedness merely means right-mindedness in\nthe sense that we are now using it. The right-minded neither exalt nor\ndepreciate the mind of the miracle worker or the miracle receiver.\nHowever, as a creative act, the miracle need not await the\nright-mindedness of the receiver. In fact, its purpose is to <em>restore</em> him\nto his right mind. It is essential, however, that the miracle worker be\nin his right mind or he will be unable to reestablish right-mindedness\nin someone else.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> The healer who relies on his <em>own</em> readiness is endangering his\nunderstanding. He is perfectly safe as long as he is completely\nunconcerned about <em>his</em> readiness but maintains a consistent trust in\n<em>mine</em>. If your miracle working propensities are not functioning properly,\nit is <em>always</em> because fear has intruded on your right-mindedness and has\nliterally upset it (or turned it upside-down). All forms of\nnot-right-mindedness are the result of refusal to accept the Atonement\n<em>for yourself</em>. If the miracle worker <em>does</em> accept it, he places himself in\na position to recognize that those who need to be healed are simply\nthose who have not realized that right-mindedness is healing.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> The <em>sole</em> responsibility of the miracle worker is to accept the\nAtonement for himself. This means that he recognizes that mind is the\nonly creative level and that its errors <em>are</em> healed by the Atonement.\nOnce he accepts this, his mind can <em>only</em> heal. By denying his mind any\ndestructive potential and reinstating its purely constructive powers, he\nhas placed himself in a position where he can undo the level confusion\nof others. The message he then gives to others is the truth that <em>their</em>\nminds are similarly constructive and that <em>their</em> miscreations cannot hurt\nthem. By affirming this, the miracle worker releases the mind from\nover-evaluating its own learning device (the body) and restores the mind\nto its true position as the learner.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> It should be emphasized again that the body does not learn any more\nthan it creates. As a learning device, it merely follows the learner,\nbut if it is falsely endowed with self-initiative, it becomes a serious\nobstruction to the very learning it should facilitate. <em>Only</em> the mind is\ncapable of illumination. The Soul is already illuminated, and the body\nin itself is too dense. The mind, however, can bring <em>its</em> illumination <em>to</em>\nthe body by recognizing that density is the opposite of intelligence and\ntherefore unamenable to independent learning. It is, however, easily\nbrought into alignment with a mind which has learned to look beyond\ndensity toward light.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> Corrective learning always begins with the awakening of the Spiritual\neye and the turning away from the belief in physical sight. The reason\nthis so often entails fear is because man is afraid of what his\nSpiritual eye will see. We said before that the Spiritual eye cannot see\nerror and is capable only of looking beyond it to the defense of\nAtonement. There is no doubt that the Spiritual eye <em>does</em> produce extreme\ndiscomfort by what it sees. Yet what man forgets is that the discomfort\nis <em>not</em> the final outcome of its perception. When the Spiritual eye is\npermitted to look upon the defilement of the altar, it also looks\n<em>immediately</em> toward the Atonement.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> <em>Nothing</em> the Spiritual eye perceives can induce fear. <em>Everything</em> that\nresults from accurate spiritual awareness is merely channelized toward\ncorrection. Discomfort is aroused only to bring the <em>need</em> for correction\nforcibly into awareness. What the physical eye sees is <em>not</em> corrective\nnor can it be corrected by <em>any</em> device which can be seen physically. As\nlong as a man believes in what his physical sight tells him, <em>all</em> his\ncorrective behavior will be misdirected. The <em>real</em> vision is obscured,\nbecause man cannot endure to see his own defiled altar. But since the\naltar <em>has</em> been defiled, his state becomes doubly dangerous unless it <em>is</em>\nperceived.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> The fear of healing arises, in the end, from an unwillingness to\naccept the unequivocal fact that healing is necessary. Man is not\nwilling to look on what he has done <em>to himself</em>. Healing is an ability\nlent to man after the separation, before which it was completely\nunnecessary. Like all aspects of the space-time belief, healing ability\nis temporary. However, as long as time persists, healing is needed as a\nmeans for human protection. This is because healing rests on charity,\nand charity is a way of perceiving the perfection of another even if he\ncannot perceive it himself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> Most of the loftier concepts of which man is capable now are\ntime-dependent. Charity is really a weaker reflection of a much more\npowerful love-encompassment which is <em>far</em> beyond any form of charity that\nman can conceive of as yet. Charity is essential to right-mindedness in\nthe limited sense in which right-mindedness can now be attained. Charity\nis a way of looking at another <em>as if</em> he had already gone far beyond his\nactual accomplishments in time. Since his own thinking is faulty, he\ncannot see the Atonement for himself or he would have no need for\ncharity. The charity which is accorded him is both an acknowledgment\nthat he <em>is</em> weak and a recognition that he <em>could</em> be stronger.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> The way in which both of these perceptions are stated clearly implies\ntheir dependence on time, making it quite apparent that charity lies\nwithin the human limitations, though toward its higher levels. We said\nbefore that only revelation transcends time. The miracle, as an\nexpression of true human charity, can only shorten time at most. It must\nbe understood, however, that whenever a man offers a miracle to another,\nhe is shortening the suffering of <em>both</em>. This introduces a correction\ninto the whole record which corrects retroactively as well as\nprogressively.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>72</sup> You believe that “being afraid” is involuntary, something beyond your\ncontrol. Yet I have told you several times that only <em>constructive</em> acts\nshould be involuntary. We have said that Christ-control can take over\neverything that does <em>not</em> matter, while Christ-guidance can direct\neverything that <em>does</em> if you so choose. Fear cannot be Christ-controlled,\nbut it <em>can</em> be self-controlled. It <em>prevents</em> me from controlling it. The\ncorrection is therefore a matter of <em>your</em> will, because its presence\nshows that you have raised the <em>unimportant</em> to a higher level than it\nwarrants. You have thus brought it under <em>your</em> will, where it does not\nbelong. This means that <em>you</em> feel responsible for it. The level confusion\nhere is obvious.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> The reason I cannot control fear for you is that you are attempting\nto raise to the mind level the proper content of lower-order reality. I\ndo not foster level confusion, but <em>you</em> can choose to correct it. You\nwould not tolerate insane <em>behavior</em> on your part and would hardly advance\nthe excuse that you could not help it. Why should you tolerate insane\n<em>thinking</em>? There is a confusion here which you would do well to look at\nclearly. <em>You</em> believe that you are responsible for what you <em>do</em> but <em>not</em>\nfor what you <em>think</em>. The truth is that you are responsible for what you\nthink because it is only at this level that you <em>can</em> exercise choice.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> What you do <em>comes from</em> what you think. You cannot separate yourself\nfrom the truth by “giving” autonomy to behavior. This is controlled by\nme automatically as soon as you place what you think under my guidance.\nWhenever you are afraid, it is a sure sign that you have allowed your\nmind to miscreate or have not allowed me to guide it. It is pointless to\nbelieve that controlling the <em>outcome</em> of mis-thought can result in\nhealing. When you are fearful, you have willed wrongly. This is why you\nfeel responsible for it. You must change your <em>mind</em>, not your behavior,\nand this <em>is</em> a matter of will.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> You do not need guidance <em>except</em> at the mind level. Correction belongs\n<em>only</em> at the level where creation is possible. The term does not mean\nanything at the symptom level, where it cannot work. The correction of\nfear is your responsibility. When you ask for release from fear, you are\nimplying that it is not. You should ask instead for help in the\nconditions which have brought the fear about. These conditions <em>always</em>\nentail a separated mind willingness. At that level, you can help it. You\nare much too tolerant of mind wandering, thus passively condoning its\nmiscreations. The particular result does not matter, but the fundamental\nerror <em>does</em>. The correction is always the same. Before you will to do\nanything, ask me if your will is in accord with mine. If you are sure\nthat it is, there will <em>be</em> no fear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> Fear is always a sign of strain, which arises whenever the <em>will</em> to do\nconflicts with <em>what</em> you do. This situation arises in two ways:</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> First, you can will to do conflicting things, either simultaneously\nor successively. This produces conflicted behavior, which is intolerable\nto yourself because the part of the will that wants to do something <em>else</em>\nis outraged.</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> Second, you can <em>behave</em> as you think you should but without entirely\n<em>willing</em> to do so. This produces consistent behavior but entails great\nstrain <em>within</em> the self.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> In both cases, the will and the behavior are out of accord, resulting\nin a situation in which you are doing what you do <em>not</em> will. This arouses\na sense of coercion, which usually produces rage. The rage then invades\nthe mind and projection in the wrong sense is likely to follow.\nDepression or anxiety is virtually certain. Remember that whenever there is fear, it is because you have <em>not\nmade up your mind</em>. Your will is split, and your behavior inevitably\nbecomes erratic. Correcting at the behavioral level can shift the error\nfrom the first to the second type of strain described above but will <em>not</em>\nobliterate the fear. It is possible to reach a state in which you bring\nyour will under my guidance without much conscious effort, but this\nimplies habit patterns which you have not developed dependably as yet.\nGod cannot ask <em>more</em> than you will. The strength to <em>do</em> comes from your\nown undivided <em>will</em> to do. There is <em>no</em> strain in doing God’s Will as soon\nas you recognize that it is also your <em>own</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> The lesson here is quite simple but particularly apt to be\noverlooked. I will therefore repeat it, urging you to listen. Only your\n<em>mind</em> can produce fear. It does so whenever it is conflicted in what it\nwills, thus producing inevitable strain because willing and doing become\ndiscordant. This cannot be corrected by better <em>doing</em>, but it <em>can</em> be\ncorrected by higher <em>willing</em>.</p>",

Then say to yourself that you must somehow have willed not to\nlove, or the fear which arises from behavior-will conflict could not\nhave arisen. Then the whole process is nothing more than a series of\npragmatic steps in the larger process of accepting the Atonement as <em>the</em>\nremedy. These steps can be summarized as follows:</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> 1. Know first that this is fear.</p><p><sup>84</sup> 2. Fear arises from lack of love.</p><p><sup>85</sup> 3. The <em>only</em> remedy for lack of love is perfect love.</p><p><sup>86</sup> 4. Perfect love is the Atonement.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> We have emphasized that the miracle, or the <em>expression</em> of Atonement,\nis always a sign of real respect <em>from</em> the worthy <em>to</em> the worthy. This\nworth is re-established by the Atonement. It is obvious, then, that when\nyou are afraid you have placed yourself in a position where you <em>need</em>\nAtonement, because you have done something loveless, having willed\nwithout love. This is precisely the situation for which the Atonement\nwas offered. The need for the remedy inspired its creation. As long as\nyou recognize only the need for the remedy, you will remain fearful.\nHowever, as soon as you remedy it, you have also abolished the fear.\nThis is how true healing occurs.</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> Everyone experiences fear, and no one enjoys it. Yet it would take\nvery little right-thinking to realize why fear occurs. Very few people\nappreciate the real power of the mind, and no one remains fully aware of\nit all the time. However, if anyone hopes to spare himself from fear,\nthere are some things he must realize and realize fully. The mind is a\nvery powerful creator, and it never loses its creative force. It never\nsleeps. Every instant it is creating and <em>always</em> as you will. Many of\nyour ordinary expressions reflect this. For example, when you say,\n“Don’t give it a thought,” you imply that if you do not think about\nsomething, it will have no effect on you. And this is true enough.</p>\n\n<p><sup>89</sup> On the other hand, many other expressions clearly illustrate the\nprevailing <em>lack</em> of awareness of thought-power. For example, you say,\n“Just an idle thought,” and mean that the thought has no effect. You\nalso speak of some actions as “thoughtless,” implying that if the person\nhad thought, he would not behave as he did. While expressions like\n“think big” give some recognition to the power of thought, they still\ncome nowhere near the truth. You do not expect to grow when you say it,\nbecause you do not really think that you will.</p>\n\n<p><sup>90</sup> It is hard to recognize that thought and belief combine into a power\nsurge that can literally move mountains. It appears at first glance that\nto believe such power about yourself is merely arrogant, but that is not\nthe real reason why you do not believe it. People <em>prefer</em> to believe that\ntheir thoughts cannot exert real control, because they are <em>literally</em>\nafraid of them. Many psychotherapists attempt to help people who are\nafraid, say, of their death wishes by depreciating the power of the\nwish. They even try to “free” the patient by persuading him that he can\nthink whatever he wants without any <em>real</em> effect at all.</p>\n\n<p><sup>91</sup> There is a real dilemma here which only the truly right-minded can\nescape. Death wishes do not kill in the physical sense, but they <em>do</em> kill\nspiritual awareness. <em>All</em> destructive thinking is dangerous. Given a\ndeath wish, a man has no choice except to <em>act</em> upon the thought or behave\n<em>contrary</em> to it. He thus chooses <em>only</em> between homicide and fear. The\nother possibility is that he depreciates the power of his thought. This\nis the usual psychoanalytic approach. It <em>does</em> allay guilt but at the\ncost of rendering thinking impotent. If you believe that what you think\nis ineffectual you may cease to be overly afraid of it, but you are\nhardly likely to respect it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>92</sup> The world is full of examples of how man has depreciated himself\nbecause he is afraid of his own thoughts. In some forms of insanity,\nthoughts are glorified, but this is only because the underlying\ndepreciation was too effective for tolerance. The truth is that there\n<em>are</em> no “idle” thoughts. <em>All</em> thinking produces form at some level. The\nreason people are afraid of ESP and so often react against it is because\nthey <em>know</em> that thoughts can hurt them. Their own thoughts have made them\nvulnerable.</p>\n\n<p><sup>93</sup> You who constantly complain about fear still persist in creating it.\nI told you before that you cannot ask <em>me</em> to release you from fear\nbecause I <em>know</em> it does not exist, but <em>you</em> do not. If I merely intervened\nbetween your thoughts and their results, I would be tampering with a\nbasic law of cause and effect, the most fundamental law there is in this\nworld. I would hardly help if I depreciated the power of your own\nthinking. This would be in direct opposition to the purpose of this\ncourse. It is much more helpful to remind you that you do not guard your\nthoughts carefully except for a small part of the day and somewhat\ninconsistently even then. You may feel at this point that it would take\na miracle to enable you to do this, which is perfectly true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>94</sup> Men are not used to miraculous thinking, but they can be <em>trained</em> to\nthink that way. All miracle workers need that kind of training. I cannot\nlet them leave their minds unguarded, or they will not be able to help\nme. Miracle working entails a full realization of the power of thought\nand real avoidance of miscreation. Otherwise, a miracle will be\nnecessary to set the mind <em>itself</em> straight, a circular process which\nwould hardly foster the time collapse for which the miracle was\nintended. Nor would it induce the healthy respect for true cause and\neffect which every miracle worker must have.</p>\n\n<p><sup>95</sup> [Miracles cannot free the miracle worker from fear.] Both miracles\n<em>and</em> fear come from thoughts, and if you were not free to choose one, you\nwould also not be free to choose the other. By choosing the miracle, you\n<em>have</em> rejected fear. You have been afraid of God, of me, of yourselves,\nand of practically everyone you know at one time or another. This is\nbecause you have misperceived or miscreated us and believe in what you\nhave made. You would never have done this if you were not afraid of your\nown thoughts. The vulnerable are essentially miscreators because they\nmisperceive creation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>96</sup> You persist in believing that when you do not consciously watch your\nmind, it is unmindful. It is time, however, to consider the whole world\nof the unconscious or “unwatched” mind. This may well frighten you\nbecause it is the <em>source</em> of fear. The unwatched mind is responsible for\nthe whole content of the unconscious which lies <em>above</em> the miracle level.\nAll psychoanalytic theorists have made some contribution in this\nconnection, but none of them has seen it in its true entirety. They have\nall made one common error in that they attempted to uncover unconscious\n<em>content</em>. You cannot understand unconscious activity in these terms\nbecause “content” is applicable <em>only</em> to the more superficial unconscious\nlevels, to which the individual himself contributes. This is the level\nat which he can readily introduce fear and usually does.</p>\n\n<p><sup>97</sup> When man miscreates he is in pain. The cause and effect principle\nhere is temporarily a real expediter. Actually, “Cause” is a term\nproperly belonging to God, and “Effect,” which should also be\ncapitalized, is His Son. This entails a set of Cause and Effect\nrelationships which are totally different from those which man\nintroduced into his own miscreations. The fundamental opponents in the\nreal basic conflict are creation and miscreation. All <em>fear</em> is implicit\nin the second, just as all <em>love</em> is inherent in the first. Because of\nthis difference, the basic conflict <em>is</em> one between love and fear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>98</sup> It has already been said that man believes he <em>cannot</em> control fear\nbecause he himself created it. His belief in it seems to render it out\nof his control by definition. Yet any attempt to resolve the basic\nconflict through the concept of <em>mastery</em> of fear is meaningless. In fact\nit asserts the <em>power</em> of fear by the simple assumption that it <em>need</em> be\nmastered. The essential resolution rests entirely on the mastery of\n<em>love</em>. In the interim, the sense of conflict is inevitable since man has\nplaced himself in a strangely illogical position. He believes in the\npower of what does not exist.</p>\n\n<p><sup>99</sup> Two concepts which <em>cannot</em> coexist are “nothing” and “everything.” To\nwhatever extent one is believed in, the other <em>has been</em> denied. In the\nconflict fear is really nothing, and love is everything. This is because\nwhenever light enters darkness, the darkness <em>is</em> abolished. What man\nbelieves <em>is</em> true for him. In this sense the separation <em>has</em> occurred, and\nto deny this is merely to misuse denial. However, to concentrate on\nerror is merely a further misuse of defenses. The true corrective\nprocedure is to recognize error temporarily but <em>only</em> as an indication\nthat <em>immediate</em> correction is mandatory. This establishes a state of mind\nin which the Atonement can be accepted <em>without</em> delay.</p>\n\n<p><sup>100</sup> It should be emphasized, however, that ultimately there is no\ncompromise possible between everything and nothing. Time is essentially\na device by which all compromise in this respect can be given up. It\nseems to be abolished by degrees because time itself involves a concept\nof intervals which do not really exist. The faulty use of creation made\nthis necessary as a corrective device. “And God so loved the world that\nHe gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him shall not\nperish, but have eternal life” needs only one slight correction to be\nentirely meaningful in this context. It should read, “He gave it <em>to</em> His\nonly begotten Son.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>101</sup> It should especially be noted that God has only <em>one</em> Son. If all the\nSouls God created <em>are</em> His Sons, then every Soul <em>must</em> be an integral part\nof the whole Sonship. You do not find the concept that the whole is\ngreater than its parts difficult to understand. You should therefore not\nhave too much trouble in understanding this.</p>\n\n<p><sup>102</sup> The Sonship in its oneness does transcend the sum of its parts.\nHowever, this is obscured as long as any of its parts are missing. That\nis why the conflict cannot ultimately be resolved until <em>all</em> the parts of\nthe Sonship have returned. Only then can the meaning of wholeness, in\nthe true sense, be fully understood.</p>\n\n<p><sup>103</sup> Any part of the Sonship can believe in error or incompleteness if he\nso elects. However, if he does so, he is believing in the existence of\nnothingness. The correction of this error is the Atonement. We have\nalready briefly spoken about readiness, but there are some additional\npoints which might be helpful here. Readiness is nothing more than the\n<em>prerequisite</em> for accomplishment. The two should not be confused. As soon\nas a state of readiness occurs, there is usually some will to\naccomplish, but this is by no means necessarily undivided. The state\ndoes not imply more than a <em>potential</em> for a shift of will.</p>\n\n<p><sup>104</sup> Confidence cannot develop fully until mastery has been accomplished.\nWe have already attempted to correct the fundamental error that fear can\nbe mastered and have emphasized that only <em>love</em> can be mastered. You have\nattested only to your readiness. Mastery of love involves a much more\ncomplete confidence than either of you has attained. However, the\nreadiness at least is an indication that you believe this is possible.\nThat is only the beginning of confidence. In case this be misunderstood\nto imply that an enormous amount of time will be necessary between\nreadiness and mastery, let me remind you that time and space are under\nmy control.</p>\n\n<p><sup>105</sup> One of the chief ways in which man can correct his magic-miracle\nconfusion is to remember that he did not create himself. He is apt to\nforget this when he becomes egocentric, and this places him in a\nposition where the belief in magic in some form is virtually inevitable.\nHis will to create was given him by his own Creator, Who was expressing\nthe same will in His creation. Since creative ability rests in the mind,\neverything that man creates is necessarily a matter of will. It also\nfollows that whatever he creates is real in his own sight but not\nnecessarily in the sight of God. This basic distinction leads us\ndirectly into the real meaning of the Last Judgment.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>106</sup> The Last Judgment is one of the greatest threat concepts in man’s\nperception. This is only because he does not understand it. Judgment is\nnot an essential attribute of God. Man brought judgment into being only\nbecause of the separation. After the separation, however, there <em>was</em> a\nplace for judgment as one of the many learning devices which had to be\nbuilt into the overall plan. Just as the separation occurred over many\nmillions of years, the Last Judgment will extend over a similarly long\nperiod and perhaps an even longer one. Its length depends, however, on\nthe effectiveness of the present speed-up.</p>\n\n<p><sup>107</sup> We have frequently noted that the miracle is a device for shortening\nbut not abolishing time. If a sufficient number of people become truly\nmiracle-minded quickly, the shortening process can be almost\nimmeasurable. It is essential, however, that these individuals free\nthemselves from fear sooner than would ordinarily be the case because\nthey must emerge from the conflict if they are to bring peace to other\nminds.</p>\n\n<p><sup>108</sup> The Last Judgment is generally thought of as a procedure undertaken\nby God. Actually it will be undertaken by man with my help. It is a\nfinal healing rather than a meting out of punishment, however much man\nmay think that punishment is deserved. Punishment is a concept in <em>total</em>\nopposition to right-mindedness. The aim of the Last Judgment is to\n<em>restore</em> right-mindedness to man.</p>\n\n<p><sup>109</sup> The Last Judgment might be called a process of right evaluation. It\nsimply means that finally all men will come to understand what is worthy\nand what is not. After this, their ability to choose can be directed\nreasonably. Until this distinction is made, however, the vacillations\nbetween free and imprisoned will cannot <em>but</em> continue. The first step\ntoward freedom <em>must</em> entail a sorting out of the false from the true.\nThis is a process of division only in the constructive sense and\nreflects the true meaning of the Apocalypse. Man will ultimately look\nupon his own creations and will to preserve only what is good, just as\nGod Himself looked upon what He had created and knew that it <em>was</em> good.</p>\n\n<p><sup>110</sup> At this point, the will can begin to look with love on its own\ncreations because of their great worthiness. The mind will inevitably\ndisown its miscreations which, without the mind’s belief, will no longer\nexist. The term “Last Judgment” is frightening not only because it has\nbeen falsely projected onto God, but also because of the association of\n“last” with death. This is an outstanding example of upside-down\nperception. Actually, if the meaning of the Last Judgment is objectively\nexamined, it is quite apparent that it is really the doorway to life.</p>\n\n<p><sup>111</sup> No one who lives in fear is really alive. His own last judgment\ncannot be directed toward himself because he is not his own creation. He\ncan, however, apply it meaningfully and at <em>any</em> time to everything he has\ncreated and retain in his memory <em>only</em> what is good. This is what his\nright-mindedness cannot <em>but</em> dictate. The purpose of time is solely to\n“give him time” to achieve this judgment. It is his own perfect judgment\nof his own creations. When everything he retains is loveable, there is\nno reason for fear to remain with him. This <em>is</em> his part in the\nAtonement.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>11</sup> There is another point which must be perfectly clear before any\nresidual fear which may still be associated with miracles becomes\nentirely groundless. The crucifixion did <em>not</em> establish the Atonement.\nThe resurrection did. This is a point which many very sincere Christians\nhave misunderstood. No one who is free of the scarcity-error could\n<em>possibly</em> make this mistake. If the crucifixion is seen from an\nupside-down point of view, it <em>does</em> appear as if God permitted and even\nencouraged one of his Sons to suffer <em>because</em> he was good. Many ministers\npreach this every day.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> This particularly unfortunate interpretation, which arose out of the\ncombined misprojections of a large number of my would-be followers, has\nled many people to be bitterly afraid of God. This particularly\nanti-religious concept enters into many religions, and this is neither\nby chance nor by coincidence. Yet the real Christian would have to pause\nand ask, “How could this be?” Is it likely that God Himself would be\ncapable of the kind of thinking which His own words have clearly stated\nis unworthy of man?</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> The best defense, as always, is not to attack another’s position but\nrather to protect the truth. It is unwise to accept any concept if you\nhave to turn a whole frame of reference around in order to justify it.\nThis procedure is painful in its minor applications and genuinely tragic\non a mass basis. Persecution is a frequent result, undertaken to justify\nthe terrible misperception that God Himself persecuted His own Son on\nbehalf of salvation. The very words are meaningless.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> It has been particularly difficult to overcome this because, although\nthe error itself is no harder to overcome than any other error, men were\nunwilling to give this one up because of its prominent “escape” value.\nIn milder forms a parent says, “This hurts me more than it hurts you,”\nand feels exonerated in beating a child. Can you believe that the Father\n<em>really</em> thinks this way? It is so essential that all such thinking be\ndispelled that we must be very sure that <em>nothing</em> of this kind remains in\nyour mind. I was not punished because you were bad. The wholly benign\nlesson the Atonement teaches is lost if it is tainted with this kind of\ndistortion in <em>any</em> form.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> “Vengeance is Mine sayeth the Lord,” is a strictly karmic viewpoint.\nIt is a real misperception of truth by which man assigns his own “evil”\npast to God. The “evil conscience” from the past has nothing to do with\nGod. He did not create it, and He does not maintain it. God does <em>not</em>\nbelieve in karmic retribution. His Divine Mind does not create that way.\n<em>He</em> does not hold the evil deeds of a man even against himself. Is it\nlikely, then, that He would hold against anyone the evil that <em>another</em>\ndid?</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> Be very sure that you recognize how utterly impossible this\nassumption really is and how <em>entirely</em> it arises from misprojection. This\nkind of error is responsible for a host of related errors including the\nbelief that God rejected man and forced him out of the Garden of Eden.\nIt is also responsible for the fact that you may believe from time to\ntime that I am misdirecting you. I have made every effort to use words\nthat are almost impossible to distort, but man is very inventive when it\ncomes to twisting symbols around.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> God Himself is <em>not</em> symbolic; He is <em>fact</em>. The Atonement too is totally\nwithout symbolism. It is perfectly clear because it exists in light.\nOnly man’s attempts to shroud it in darkness have made it inaccessible\nto the unwilling and ambiguous to the partly willing. The Atonement\nitself radiates nothing but truth. It therefore epitomizes harmlessness\nand sheds <em>only</em> blessing. It could not do this if it arose from anything\nbut perfect innocence. Innocence is wisdom because it is unaware of\nevil, which does not exist. It is, however, <em>perfectly</em> aware of\n<em>everything</em> that is true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> The Resurrection demonstrated that <em>nothing</em> can destroy truth. Good\n<em>can</em> withstand any form of evil because light abolishes <em>all</em> forms of\ndarkness. The Atonement is thus the perfect lesson. It is the final\ndemonstration that all of the other lessons which I taught are true. Man\nis released from <em>all</em> errors if he believes in this. The deductive\napproach to teaching accepts the generalization which is applicable to\n<em>all</em> single instances rather than building up the generalization after\nanalyzing numerous single instances separately. If you can accept the\n<em>one</em> generalization <em>now</em>, there will be no need to learn from many smaller\nlessons.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> <em>Nothing</em> can prevail against a Son of God who commends his Spirit into\nthe hands of his Father. By doing this, the mind awakens from its sleep\nand [the Soul] remembers its Creator. All sense of separation\ndisappears, and level confusion vanishes. The Son of God <em>is</em> part of the\nHoly Trinity, but the Trinity itself is <em>One</em>. There is no confusion\nwithin its levels because they are of One Mind and One Will. This single\npurpose creates perfect integration and establishes the peace of God.\nYet this vision can be perceived only by the truly innocent.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> Because their hearts are pure, the innocent defend true perception\ninstead of defending themselves <em>against</em> it. Understanding the lesson of\nthe Atonement, they are without the will to attack, and therefore they\nsee truly. This is what the Bible means when it says, “When He shall\nappear (or be perceived) we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as\nHe <em>is</em>.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> Sacrifice is a notion totally unknown to God. It arises solely from\nfear. This is particularly unfortunate because frightened people are apt\nto be vicious. Sacrificing another in <em>any</em> way is a clear cut violation\nof God’s own injunction that man should be merciful even as his Father\nin Heaven. It has been hard for many Christians to realize that this\ncommandment (or assignment) also applies to <em>themselves</em>. Good teachers\nnever terrorize their students. To terrorize is to attack, and this\nresults in rejection of what the teacher offers. The result is learning\nfailure.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> I have been correctly referred to as “the Lamb of God who taketh away\nthe sins of the world.” Those who represent the lamb as blood-stained,\nan all-too-widespread error, do <em>not</em> understand the meaning of the\nsymbol. Correctly understood, it is a very simple parable which merely\nspeaks of my innocence. The lion and the lamb lying down together refers\nto the fact that strength and innocence are <em>not</em> in conflict but\nnaturally live in peace. “Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall\nsee God” is another way of saying the same thing.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> There has been some human controversy about the nature of seeing in\nrelation to the integrative powers of the brain. Correctly understood,\nthe issue revolves around the question of whether the body or the mind\ncan see (or understand). This is not really open to question at all. The\nbody is not capable of understanding, and only the mind can perceive\n<em>anything</em>. A pure mind knows the truth, and this <em>is</em> its strength. It\ncannot attack the body because it recognizes exactly what the body <em>is</em>.\nThis is what “a sane mind in a sane body” really means. It does <em>not</em>\nconfuse destruction with innocence because it associates innocence with\nstrength, <em>not</em> with weakness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> Innocence is <em>incapable</em> of sacrificing anything, because the innocent\nmind <em>has</em> everything and strives only to <em>protect</em> its wholeness. This is\nwhy it <em>cannot</em> misproject. It can only honor man, because honor is the\nnatural greeting of the truly loved to others who are like them. The\nlamb taketh away the sins of the world only in the sense that the state\nof innocence, or grace, is one in which the meaning of the Atonement is\nperfectly apparent. The innocence of God is the true state of mind of\nHis Son. In this state, man’s mind <em>does</em> see God [and because] he sees\nHim as he is[, he knows] that the Atonement, <em>not</em> sacrifice, is the <em>only</em>\nappropriate gift to His own altar, where nothing except true perfection\nbelongs. The understanding of the innocent is <em>truth</em>. That is why their\naltars are truly radiant.</p>\n\n",

It is essential\nthat you realize that behavior is erratic until a firm commitment to one\nor the other is made.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> A firm commitment to darkness or nothingness is impossible.

This makes everyone really unable to deny truth totally,\neven if he generally deceives himself in this connection. That is why\nthose who live largely in darkness and emptiness never find any lasting\nsolace. Innocence is <em>not</em> a partial attribute. It is not a real defense\n<em>until</em> it is total. When it is partial, it is characterized by the same\nerratic nature that holds for other two-edged defenses.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> The partly innocent are apt to be quite stupid at times. It is not\nuntil their innocence becomes a genuine viewpoint which is universal in\nits application that it becomes wisdom. Innocent (or true) perception\nmeans that you <em>never</em> misperceive and <em>always</em> see truly. More simply, it\nmeans that you never see what does not really exist. When you lack\nconfidence in what someone will do, you are attesting to your belief\nthat he is not in his right mind. This is hardly a miracle-based frame\nof reference. It also has the disastrous effect of denying the creative\npower of the miracle.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> The miracle perceives everything <em>as it is</em>. If nothing but the truth\nexists (and this is really a redundant statement, because what is not\ntrue <em>cannot</em> exist) right-minded seeing cannot see anything <em>but</em>\nperfection.

If you are\nwilling to validate what <em>is</em> true in everything you perceive, you will\nmake it true for <em>you</em>. Truth overcomes <em>all</em> error. This means that if you\nperceive truly, you are canceling out misperceptions in yourself <em>and</em> in\nothers simultaneously. Because you see them as they are, you offer them\nyour own validation of <em>their</em> truth. This is the healing which the\nmiracle actively fosters.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>30</sup> We have been emphasizing perception and have said very little about\ncognition as yet, because you are confused about the difference between\nthem. The reason we have dealt so little with cognition is because you\nmust get your perceptions straightened out before you can <em>know</em> anything.\nTo know is to be certain. Uncertainty merely means that you do <em>not</em> know.\nKnowledge is power <em>because</em> it is certain, and certainty is strength.\nPerception is merely temporary. It is an attribute of the space-time\nbelief and is therefore subject to fear or love. Misperceptions produce\nfear, and true perceptions produce love. <em>Neither</em> produces certainty,\nbecause <em>all</em> perception varies. That is why it is <em>not</em> knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> True perception is the <em>basis</em> for knowledge, but <em>knowing</em> is the\naffirmation of truth. All your difficulties ultimately stem from the\nfact that you do not recognize or <em>know</em> yourselves, each other, or God.\nTo recognize means to “know again,” implying that you knew before. You\ncan see in many ways, because perception involves different\ninterpretations, and this means that it is not whole. The miracle is a\nway of perceiving, <em>not</em> of knowing. It is the right answer to a question,\nand you do not ask questions at all when you know.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> Questioning illusions is the first step in undoing them. The miracle,\nor the “right answer,” corrects them. Since perceptions <em>change</em>, their\ndependence on time is obvious. They are subject to transitory states,\nand this necessarily implies variability. How you perceive at any given\ntime determines what you <em>do</em>, and action <em>must</em> occur in time. Knowledge is\ntimeless, because certainty is <em>not</em> questionable. You <em>know</em> when you have\n<em>ceased</em> to ask questions.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> The questioning mind perceives itself in time and therefore looks for\n<em>future</em> answers. The unquestioning mind is closed because it believes the\nfuture and present will be the same. This establishes an unchanged state\nor stasis. It is usually an attempt to counteract an underlying fear\nthat the future will be <em>worse</em> than the present, and this fear inhibits\nthe tendency to question at all.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> Visions are the natural perception of the Spiritual eye, but they are\nstill corrections. The Spiritual eye is symbolic and therefore not a\ndevice for knowing. It <em>is</em>, however, a means of right perception, which\nbrings it into the proper domain of the miracle. Properly speaking, “a\nvision of God” is a miracle rather than a revelation. The fact that\nperception is involved at all removes the experience from the realm of\nknowledge. That is why visions do not last.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> The Bible instructs you to “<em>know</em> yourself” or <em>be certain</em>. Certainty\nis <em>always</em> of God. When you love someone, you have perceived him as he\nis, and this makes it possible for you to <em>know</em> him. However, it is not\nuntil you <em>recognize</em> him that you can know him. While you ask questions\nabout God, you are clearly implying that you do <em>not</em> know Him. Certainty\ndoes not require action. When you say that you are <em>acting</em> on the basis\nof knowledge, you are really confusing perception and cognition.\nKnowledge brings the mental strength for creative <em>thinking</em> but <em>not</em> for\nright <em>doing</em>. Perception, miracles, and doing are closely related.\nKnowledge is the result of revelation and induces only thought.\nPerception involves the body, even in its most spiritualized form.\nKnowledge comes from the altar within and is timeless because it is\ncertain. To perceive the truth is <em>not</em> the same as knowing it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> If you attack error in one another, you will hurt yourself. You\ncannot <em>recognize</em> each other when you attack. Attack is <em>always</em> made on a\nstranger. You are <em>making</em> him a stranger by misperceiving him so that you\n<em>cannot</em> know him. It is <em>because</em> you have made him a stranger that you are\nafraid of him. <em>Perceive</em> him correctly so that you can <em>know</em> him. Right\nperception is necessary before God can communicate directly to His own\naltars which He has established in His Sons. There He can communicate\nHis certainty, and <em>His</em> knowledge will bring peace <em>without</em> question.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> God is not a stranger to His Sons, and His Sons are not strangers to\neach other. Knowledge preceded both perception and time and will\nultimately replace them. That is the real meaning of the Biblical\ndescription of God as “Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End.” It\nalso explains the quotation, “Before Abraham was <em>I am</em>.” Perception can\nand must be stabilized, but knowledge <em>is</em> stable. “Fear God and keep His\ncommandments” should read “<em>Know</em> God and accept His certainty.” There are\nno strangers in His creation. To create as He created, you can create\nonly what you <em>know</em> and accept as yours. God knows His Children with\nperfect certainty. He created them <em>by</em> knowing them. He recognized them\nperfectly. When they do not recognize each other, they do not recognize\nHim.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>38</sup> [The Soul knows, loves, and creates. These are its unequivocal\nfunctions.] The abilities man now possesses are only shadows of his real\nstrengths. All of his functions are equivocal and open to question or\ndoubt. This is because he is not certain how he will <em>use</em> them. He is\ntherefore incapable of knowledge, being uncertain. He is also incapable\nof knowledge, because he can perceive lovelessly. He cannot create\nsurely, because his perception deceives [and illusions are not pure].\nPerception did not exist until the separation had introduced degrees,\naspects, and intervals. The Soul has no levels, and <em>all</em> conflict arises\nfrom the concept of levels. [Wars arise where some regard others as if\nthey were on a different level. All interpersonal conflicts arise from\nthis fallacy.] Only the levels of the Trinity are capable of unity. The\nlevels which man created by the separation cannot <em>but</em> conflict. This is\nbecause they are essentially meaningless to each other.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> Freud realized this perfectly and that is why he conceived the\ndifferent levels in his view of the psyche as forever irreconcilable.\nThey were conflict-prone by definition, because they wanted different\nthings and obeyed different principles. In <em>our</em> picture of the psyche,\nthere is an unconscious level which properly consists <em>only</em> of the\nmiracle ability and which should be under <em>my</em> direction. There is also a\nconscious level, which perceives or is aware of impulses from both the\nunconscious and the superconscious.  Consciousness is thus the level of\nperception but <em>not</em> of knowledge. Again, to perceive is <em>not</em> to know.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> Consciousness was the first split that man introduced into himself.\nHe became a <em>perceiver</em> rather than a creator in the true sense.\nConsciousness is correctly identified as the domain of the ego. The ego\nis a man-made attempt to perceive himself as he <em>wished</em> to be rather than\nas he <em>is</em>. This is an example of the created-creator confusion we have\nspoken of before. Yet man can only know himself as he is because that is\nall he can be <em>sure</em> of. Everything else <em>is</em> open to question.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> The ego is the questioning compartment in the post-separation psyche\nwhich man created for himself. It is capable of asking valid questions\nbut <em>not</em> of perceiving valid answers because these are cognitive and\ncannot <em>be</em> perceived. The endless speculation about the meaning of mind\nhas led to considerable confusion because the mind <em>is</em> confused. Only\nOne-Mindedness is without confusion. A separated or divided mind <em>must</em> be\nconfused; it is uncertain by definition. It <em>has</em> to be in conflict\nbecause it is out of accord with itself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> Intrapersonal conflict arises from the same basis as interpersonal\nconflict. One part of the psyche perceives another part as on a\ndifferent level and does not understand it. This makes the parts\nstrangers to each other, without recognition. This is the essence of the\nfear-prone condition in which attack is <em>always</em> possible. Man has every\nreason to feel afraid as he perceives himself. This is why he cannot\nescape from fear until he <em>knows</em> that he did not and could not create\nhimself. He can <em>never</em> make his misperceptions valid. His creation is\nbeyond his own error, and that is why he <em>must</em> eventually choose to heal\nthe separation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> Right-mindedness is not to be confused with the <em>knowing</em> mind, because\nit is applicable only to right perception. You can be right-minded or\nwrong-minded, and even this is subject to degrees, a fact which clearly\ndemonstrates a lack of association with knowledge. The term\n“right-mindedness” is properly used as the <em>correction</em> for\n“wrong-mindedness,” and applies to the state of mind which induces\naccurate perception. It is miraculous because it <em>heals</em> misperception,\nand this is indeed a miracle in view of how man perceives himself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> Perception <em>always</em> involves some misuse of will, because it involves\nthe mind in areas of uncertainty. The mind is very active because it has\nwill-power. When it willed the separation, it willed to perceive. Until\nthen, it willed <em>only</em> to know. Afterwards it willed ambiguously, and the\nonly way <em>out</em> of ambiguity <em>is</em> clear perception. The mind returns to its\nproper function only when it <em>wills to know</em>. This places it in the Soul’s\nservice, where perception is meaningless. The superconscious is the\nlevel of the mind which wills this.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> The mind chose to divide itself when it willed to create both its own\nlevels <em>and</em> the ability to perceive, but it could not entirely separate\nitself <em>from</em> the Soul because it is from the Soul that it derives its\nwhole power to create. Even in miscreation will is affirming its Source\nor it would merely cease to be. This is impossible because it is part of\nthe Soul which God created and which is therefore eternal.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> The ability to perceive made the body possible because you must\nperceive <em>something</em> and <em>with</em> something. This is why perception involves\nan exchange or translation, which knowledge does not need. The\ninterpretive function of perception, actually a distorted form of\ncreation, then permitted man to interpret the body as <em>himself</em>, which,\nthough depressing, was an attempt to escape from the conflict he had\ninduced. The superconscious, which <em>knows</em>, could not be reconciled with\nthis loss of power because it is incapable of darkness. This is why it\nbecame almost inaccessible to the mind and entirely inaccessible to the\nbody.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> Thereafter, the superconscious was perceived as a threat, because\nlight does abolish darkness merely by establishing the fact that it is\nnot there. The truth will <em>always</em> overcome error in this sense. This is\nnot an <em>active</em> process of destruction at all. We have already emphasized\nthat knowledge does not <em>do anything</em>. It can be <em>perceived</em> as an attacker,\nbut it <em>cannot</em> attack. What man perceives as its attack is merely his own\nvague recognition of the fact that it can always be <em>remembered</em>, never\nhaving been destroyed.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> God and the Souls He created remain in surety, and therefore <em>know</em>\nthat no miscreation exists. Truth cannot deal with unwilling error\nbecause it does not will to be blocked out. I was a man who remembered\nthe Soul and its knowledge, and as a man I did not attempt to counteract\n<em>error</em> with knowledge so much as to <em>correct</em> error from the bottom up. I\ndemonstrated both the powerlessness of the body <em>and</em> the power of the\nmind. By uniting my will with that of my Creator, I naturally remembered\nthe Soul and its own real purpose.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> I cannot unite your will with God’s <em>for</em> you, but I <em>can</em> erase all\nmisperceptions from your mind if you will bring it under my guidance.\n<em>Only</em> your misperceptions stand in your own way. Without them your choice\nis certain. Sane perception <em>induces</em> sane choosing. The Atonement was an\nact based on true perception. I cannot choose for you, but I <em>can</em> help\nyou make your own right choice. “Many are called, but few are chosen”\nshould read, “<em>All</em> are called, but few choose to listen. Therefore, they\ndo not choose <em>right</em>.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> The “chosen ones” are merely those who choose right <em>sooner</em>. This is\nthe real meaning of the celestial speed-up. Strong wills can do this\n<em>now</em>, and you <em>will</em> find rest for your Souls. God knows you only in peace,\nand this <em>is</em> your reality.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>51</sup> We said before that the abilities which man possesses are only\nshadows of his real strengths and that the intrusion of the ability to\nperceive, which is inherently judgmental, was introduced only <em>after</em> the\nseparation. No one has been sure of anything since. You will also\nremember, however, that I made it clear that the resurrection was the\nmeans for the <em>return</em> to knowledge, which was accomplished by the union\nof my will with the Father’s. We can now make a distinction which will\ngreatly facilitate clarity in our subsequent statements.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> Since the separation, the words “create” and “make” have been greatly\nconfused. When you make something, you make it out of a sense of lack or\nneed. Anything that is made is made for a specific purpose and has no\ntrue generalizability. When you make something to fill a perceived lack,\nwhich is obviously why you would want to make anything, you are tacitly\nimplying that you believe in separation. Knowing, as we have frequently\nobserved, does not lead to doing at all.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> The confusion between your own creation and what <em>you</em> create is so\nprofound that it has become literally impossible for you to know\nanything. Knowledge is always stable, and it is quite evident that human\nbeings are not. Nevertheless, they <em>are</em> perfectly stable as God created\nthem. In this sense, when their behavior is unstable they are\n<em>disagreeing</em> with God’s idea of the creation. Man can do this if he\nchooses, but he would hardly <em>want</em> to do it if he were in his right mind.\nThe problem that bothers you most is the fundamental question which man\ncontinually asks of himself, but which cannot properly be directed to\nhimself at all. He keeps asking himself what he <em>is</em>. This implies that\nthe answer is not only one which he knows but is also one which is up to\nhim to supply.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> Man <em>cannot</em> perceive himself correctly. He <em>has</em> no image. The word\n“image” is always perception-related and <em>not</em> a product of [knowing].\nImages are symbolic and stand for something else. The current emphasis\non “changing your image” merely recognizes the power of perception, but\nit also implies that there is nothing to <em>know</em>. Knowing is <em>not</em> open to\ninterpretation. It is possible to “interpret” meaning, but this is\nalways open to error because it refers to the <em>perception</em> of meaning.\nSuch wholly needless complexities are the result of man’s attempt to\nregard himself as both separated and unseparated at the same time. It is\nimpossible to undertake a confusion as fundamental as this without\nengaging in further confusion.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> Methodologically, man’s mind has been very creative but, as always\noccurs when method and content are separated, it has not been utilized\nfor anything but an attempt to escape a fundamental and entirely\ninescapable impasse. This kind of thinking cannot result in a creative\noutcome, although it has resulted in considerable ingenuity. It is\nnoteworthy, however, that this ingenuity has almost totally divorced him\nfrom knowledge. Knowledge does not <em>require</em> ingenuity. When we say “the\ntruth shall set you free,” we mean that all this kind of thinking is a\nwaste of time, but that you <em>are</em> free of the need to engage in it if you\nare willing to let it go.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Prayer is a way of asking for something. Prayer is the medium of\nmiracles, but the only meaningful prayer is for forgiveness, because\nthose who have been forgiven <em>have</em> everything. Once forgiveness has been\naccepted, prayer in the usual sense becomes utterly meaningless.\nEssentially, a prayer for forgiveness is nothing more than a request\nthat we may be able to <em>recognize</em> something we already have. In electing\nto perceive instead of to know, man placed himself in a position where\nhe could resemble his Father <em>only</em> by miraculously perceiving. He has\nlost the knowledge that he <em>himself</em> is a miracle. Miraculous creation was\nhis Source and also his real function.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> “God created man in His own image and likeness” is correct in\nmeaning, but the words are open to considerable misinterpretation. This\nis avoided, however, if “image” is understood to mean “thought” and\n“likeness” is taken as “of a like quality.” God <em>did</em> create the Soul in\nHis own Thought and of a quality like to His own. There is nothing else.\nPerception, on the other hand, is impossible <em>without</em> a belief in “more”\nand “less.” Perception at every level involves selectivity and is\nincapable of organization without it. In all types of perception, there\nis a continual process of accepting and rejecting or organizing and\nreorganizing, of shifting and changing focus. Evaluation is an essential\npart of perception, because judgments <em>must</em> be made for selection.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> What happens to perceptions if there <em>are</em> no judgments and there is\nnothing but perfect equality? Perception becomes impossible. Truth can\nonly be <em>known</em>. All of it is equally true, and knowing any part of it <em>is</em>\nto know all of it. Only perception involves partial awareness. Knowledge\ntranscends <em>all</em> the laws which govern perception because partial\nknowledge is impossible. It is all one and <em>has</em> no separate parts. You\nwho are really one with it need but know <em>yourself</em>, and your knowledge is\ncomplete. To know God’s miracle is to know Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> Forgiveness is the healing of the perception of separation. Correct\nperception <em>of each other</em> is necessary, because minds have willed to see\nthemselves as separate. Each Soul knows God completely. That <em>is</em> the\nmiraculous power of the Soul. The fact that each one has this power\ncompletely is a fact that is entirely alien to human thinking, in which\nif anyone has everything, there is nothing <em>left</em>. God’s miracles are as\ntotal as His Thoughts because they <em>are</em> His Thoughts.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> As long as perception lasts, prayer has a place. Since perception\nrests on lack, those who perceive have not totally accepted the\nAtonement and given themselves over to truth. Perception <em>is</em> a separated\nstate, and a perceiver <em>does</em> need healing. Communion, not prayer, is the\nnatural state of those who know. God and His miracles <em>are</em> inseparable.\nHow beautiful indeed are the Thoughts of God who live in His light! Your\nworth is beyond perception because it is beyond doubt. Do not perceive\nyourself in different lights. <em>Know</em> yourself in the One Light where the\nmiracle that is you is perfectly clear.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>61</sup> We have already discussed the Last Judgment in some though\ninsufficient detail. After the Last Judgment there will be no more. This\nis symbolic only in the sense that everyone is much better off <em>without</em>\njudgment. When the Bible says, “Judge not that ye be not judged” it\nmerely means that if you judge the reality of others at all, you will be\nunable to avoid judging your own. The choice to judge rather than to\nknow was the cause of the loss of peace. Judgment is the process on\nwhich perception, but <em>not</em> cognition, rests. We have discussed this\nbefore in terms of the selectivity of perception, pointing out that\nevaluation is its obvious prerequisite.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> Judgment <em>always</em> involves rejection. It is <em>not</em> an ability which\nemphasizes only the positive aspects of what is judged, whether it be in\nor out of the self. However, what has been perceived and rejected—or\njudged and found wanting—remains in the unconscious because it <em>has</em> been\nperceived. One of the illusions from which man suffers is the belief\nthat what he judged against has no effect. This cannot be true unless he\nalso believes that what he judged against does not exist. He evidently\ndoes <em>not</em> believe this, or he would not have judged against it. It does\nnot matter in the end whether you judge right or wrong. Either way, you\nare placing your belief in the unreal. This cannot be avoided in any\ntype of judgment, because it implies the belief that reality is yours to\nchoose <em>from</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> You have no idea of the tremendous release and deep peace that comes\nfrom meeting yourselves and your brothers totally without judgment. When\nyou recognize what you and your brothers are, you will realize that\njudging them in <em>any</em> way is without meaning. In fact, their meaning is\nlost to you precisely because you are judging them. All uncertainty\ncomes from a totally fallacious belief that you are under the coercion\nof judgment. You do not need judgment to organize your life, and you\ncertainly do not need it to organize yourselves. In the presence of\nknowledge, <em>all</em> judgment is automatically suspended, and this is the\nprocess which enables recognition to <em>replace</em> perception.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> Man is very fearful of everything he has perceived but has refused to\naccept. He believes that, because he has refused to accept it, he has\nlost control over it. This is why he sees it in nightmares or in\npleasant disguises in what seem to be his happier dreams. Nothing that\nyou have refused to accept can be brought into awareness. It does <em>not</em>\nfollow that it is dangerous, but it <em>does</em> follow that you have <em>made</em> it\ndangerous.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> When you feel tired, it is merely because you have judged yourself as\ncapable of being tired. When you laugh at someone, it is because you\nhave judged him as debased. When you laugh at yourself, you are\nsingularly likely to laugh at others, if only because you cannot\ntolerate the idea of being more debased than they are. All of this does\nmake you feel tired because it is essentially disheartening. You are not\n<em>really</em> capable of being tired, but you are <em>very</em> capable of wearying\nyourselves. The strain of constant judgment is virtually intolerable. It\nis a curious thing that any ability which is so debilitating should be\nso deeply cherished.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> Yet, if you wish to be the author of reality, which is totally\nimpossible anyway, you <em>will</em> insist on holding onto judgment. You will\nalso use the term with considerable fear, believing that judgment will\nsomeday be used against <em>you</em>. To whatever extent it is used against you,\nit is due only to your belief in its efficacy as a weapon of defense for\nyour own authority. The issue of authority is really a question of\nauthorship. When an individual has an “authority problem,” it is <em>always</em>\nbecause he believes he is the author of himself, projects his delusion\nonto others, and then perceives the situation as one in which people are\nliterally fighting him for his authorship. This is the fundamental error\nof all those who believe they have usurped the power of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> The belief is very frightening to <em>them</em> but hardly troubles God. He\nis, however, eager to undo it, <em>not</em> to punish His Children, but <em>only</em>\nbecause He knows that it makes them unhappy. Souls were <em>given</em> their true\nAuthorship, but men preferred to be anonymous when they chose to\nseparate themselves from their Author. The word “authority” has been one\nof their most fearful symbols ever since.  Authority has been used for\ngreat cruelty because, being uncertain of their true Authorship, men\nbelieve that their creation was anonymous. This has left them in a\nposition where it <em>sounds</em> meaningful to consider the possibility that\nthey must have created themselves.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> The dispute over authorship has left such uncertainty in the minds of\nmen that some have even doubted whether they really exist at all.\nDespite the apparent contradiction in this position, it is in one sense\nmore tenable than the view that they created themselves. At least it\nacknowledges the fact that <em>some</em> true authorship is necessary for\nexistence.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> Only those who give over all desire to reject can <em>know</em> that their own\nrejection is impossible. You have <em>not</em> usurped the power of God, but you\n<em>have</em> lost it. Fortunately, when you lose something, it does not mean\nthat the “something” has gone. It merely means that you do not know\nwhere it is. Existence does not depend on your ability to identify it\nnor even to place it. It is perfectly possible to look on reality\nwithout judgment and merely <em>know</em> that it is there.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> Peace is a natural heritage of the Soul. Everyone is free to refuse\nto <em>accept</em> his inheritance, but he is <em>not</em> free to establish what his\ninheritance <em>is</em>. The problem which everyone must decide is the\nfundamental question of authorship. All fear comes ultimately and\nsometimes by way of very devious routes from the denial of Authorship.\nThe offense is never to God, but only to those who deny Him. To deny His\nAuthorship is to deny themselves the reason for their own peace, so that\nthey see themselves only in pieces. This strange perception <em>is</em> the\nauthority problem.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> There is no man who does not feel that he is imprisoned in some way.\nIf this is the result of his own free will, he must regard his will as\nif it were <em>not</em> free, or the obviously circular reasoning involved in his\nposition would be quite apparent. Free will <em>must</em> lead to freedom.\nJudgment <em>always</em> imprisons because it separates segments of reality\naccording to the highly unstable scales of desire. Wishes are not facts\nby definition. To wish is to imply that willing is not sufficient. Yet\nno one believes that what is wished is as real as what is willed.\nInstead of, “Seek ye first the Kingdom of Heaven” say, “<em>Will</em> ye first\nthe Kingdom of Heaven,” and you have said, “I know what I am, and I will\nto accept my own inheritance.”</p>\n\n",

Their resemblance lies in their power as <em>foundations</em>. Their\ndifference lies in what rests upon them. Both are cornerstones for\nsystems of belief by which men live. It is a mistake to believe that a\nthought system which is based on lies is weak. <em>Nothing</em> made by a Child\nof God is without power. It is essential to realize this because\notherwise you will not understand why you have so much trouble with this\ncourse and will be unable to escape from the prisons which you have made\nfor yourselves.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> You cannot resolve the authority problem by depreciating the power of\nyour minds. To do so is to deceive yourself, and this will hurt you\nbecause you <em>know</em> the strength of the mind. You also know that you <em>cannot</em>\nweaken it, any more than you can weaken God. The “devil” is a\nfrightening concept, because he is thought of as extremely powerful and\nextremely active. He is perceived as a force in combat with God,\nbattling Him for possession of the Souls He created. He deceives by lies\nand builds kingdoms of his own in which everything is in direct\nopposition to God. Yet he <em>attracts</em> men rather than repels them, and they\nare seen as willing to “sell” him their Souls in return for gifts they\n<em>recognize</em> are of no real worth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> This makes absolutely no sense. The whole picture is one in which man\nacts in a way he <em>himself</em> realizes is self-destructive but which he does\nnot choose to correct and therefore perceives the cause as beyond his\ncontrol. We have discussed the fall, or separation, before, but its\nmeaning must be clearly understood without symbols. The separation is\nnot symbolic. It is an order of reality or a system of thought that is\nreal enough in time, though <em>not</em> in eternity. All beliefs are real to the\nbeliever.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> The fruit of only <em>one</em> tree was “forbidden” to man in his symbolic\ngarden. But <em>God</em> could not have forbidden it or it could not have <em>been</em>\neaten. If God knows His Children, and I assure you that He does, would\nHe have put them in a position where their own destruction was possible?\nThe “tree” which was forbidden was named the “tree of knowledge.” Yet\nGod created knowledge and gave it freely to His creations. The symbolism\nhere has been given many interpretations, but you may be sure that <em>any</em>\ninterpretation which sees either God or His creations as capable of\ndestroying their own purpose is in error.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> Eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge is a symbolic expression\nfor incorporating into the self the ability for self-creating. This is\nthe <em>only</em> sense in which God and His Souls are <em>not</em> co-creators. The\nbelief that they are is implicit in the “self concept,” a concept now\nmade acceptable by its <em>weakness</em> and explained by a tendency of the self\nto create an <em>image</em> of itself. Its fear aspect is often ascribed to fear\nof retaliation by a “father figure,” a particularly curious idea in view\nof the fact that no one uses the term to refer to the physical father.\nIt refers to an <em>image</em> of a father in relation to an <em>image</em> of the self.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> Images are perceived, <em>not</em> known. Knowledge cannot deceive, but\nperception <em>can</em>. Man can perceive himself as self-creating, but he cannot\ndo more than <em>believe</em> it. He <em>cannot</em> make it true. And, as we said before,\nwhen you finally perceive correctly, you can only be glad that you\ncannot. But until then, the belief that you can is the central\nfoundation stone in your thought system, and all your defenses are used\nto attack ideas which might bring it to light. You still believe you are\nimages of your own creation. Your minds are split with your Souls on\nthis point, and there is <em>no</em> resolution while you believe the one thing\nthat is literally inconceivable. That is why you <em>cannot</em> create and are\nfilled with fear about what you make.</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> The mind can make the belief in separation <em>very</em> real and <em>very</em>\nfearful, and this belief <em>is</em> the “devil.” It is powerful, active,\ndestructive, and clearly in opposition to God because it literally\ndenies His Fatherhood. Never underestimate the power of this denial.\nLook at your lives and see what the devil has made. But know that this\nmaking will surely dissolve in the light of truth, because its\n<em>foundation</em> is a lie.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> Your creation by God is the <em>only</em> foundation which cannot be shaken\nbecause the light is <em>in</em> it. Your starting point is truth, and you must\nreturn to this beginning. Much has been perceived since then, but\nnothing else has happened. That is why your Souls are still in peace,\neven though your minds are in conflict. You have not yet gone back far\nenough, and that is why you become so fearful. As you approach the\nbeginning, you feel the fear of the destruction of your thought system\nupon you, as if it were the fear of death. There <em>is</em> no death, but there\n<em>is</em> a belief in death.</p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> The Bible says that the branch that bears no fruit will be cut off\nand will wither away. Be glad! The light <em>will</em> shine from the true\nFoundation of Life, and your own thought system <em>will</em> stand corrected. It\n<em>cannot</em> stand otherwise. You who fear salvation are <em>willing</em> death. Life\nand death, light and darkness, knowledge and perception are\nirreconcilable. To believe that they can be reconciled is to believe\nthat God and man can <em>not</em>. Only the oneness of knowledge is conflictless.\nYour kingdom is not of this world because it was given you from <em>beyond</em>\nthis world. Only <em>in</em> this world is the idea of an authority problem\nmeaningful. The world is not left by death but by truth, and truth can\nbe known by all those for whom the Kingdom was created and for whom it\nwaits.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>5</sup> We have spoken of many different human symptoms, and at this level\nthere is almost endless variation. There is, however, only <em>one</em> cause of\nall of them. The authority problem <em>is</em> “the root of all evil.” Money is\nbut one of its many reflections and is a reasonably representative\nexample of the kind of thinking which stems from it. The idea of buying\nand selling implies precisely the kind of exchange that the Soul cannot\nunderstand at all because its supply is always abundant and all its\ndemands are fully met.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> Every symptom which the ego has made involves a contradiction in\nterms. This is because the mind is split between the ego and the Soul,\nso that <em>whatever</em> the ego makes is incomplete and contradictory. This\nuntenable position is the result of the authority problem which, because\nit accepts the one inconceivable thought as its premise, can only\nproduce ideas which are inconceivable. The term “profess” is used quite\nfrequently in the Bible. To profess is to identify with an idea and\noffer the idea to others to be their own. The idea does not lessen; it\nbecomes <em>stronger</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> A good teacher clarifies his own ideas and strengthens them by\nteaching them. Teacher and pupil are alike in the learning process. They\nare in the same order of learning, and unless they <em>share</em> their lessons,\nthey will lack conviction. A good teacher must believe in the ideas\nwhich he professes, but he must meet another condition; he must also\nbelieve in the students to whom he offers his ideas. Many stand guard\nover their ideas because they want to protect their thought systems as\nthey are, and learning means change. Change is always fearful to the\nseparated ones because they cannot conceive of it as a change towards\n<em>healing</em> the separation. They <em>always</em> perceive it as a change towards\nfurther separation because the separation was their first experience of\nchange.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> You believe that if you allow no change to enter into your ego, your\nSoul will find peace. This profound confusion is possible only if one\nmaintains that the same thought system can stand on two foundations.\n<em>Nothing</em> can reach the Soul from the ego, and nothing <em>from</em> the Soul can\nstrengthen the ego or reduce the conflict within it. The ego <em>is</em> a\ncontradiction. Man’s self and God’s Self <em>are</em> in opposition. They are\nopposed in creation, in will, and in outcome. They are fundamentally\nirreconcilable because the Soul cannot perceive and the ego cannot know.\nThey are therefore <em>not in communication</em> and can never <em>be</em> in\ncommunication. Nevertheless, the ego can learn because its maker can be\nmisguided but <em>cannot</em> make the totally lifeless out of the life-given.\nThe Soul need not be taught, but the ego <em>must</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> The ultimate reason why learning is perceived as frightening is\nbecause learning <em>does</em> lead to the relinquishment (<em>not</em> destruction) of\nthe ego to the light of the Soul. This is the change the ego <em>must</em> fear\nbecause it does not share my charity. My lesson was like yours, and\nbecause I learned it, I can teach it. I never attack your egos, but I <em>do</em>\ntry to teach you how their thought system[s] arose. When I remind you of\nyour <em>true</em> creation, your egos cannot <em>but</em> respond with fear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> Teaching and learning are your greatest strengths now, because you\n<em>must</em> change your mind and help others change theirs. It is pointless to\nrefuse to tolerate change because you believe you can demonstrate that\nby doing so the separation has not occurred. The dreamer who doubts the\nreality of his dream while he is still dreaming is not really healing\nthe level-split. You <em>have</em> dreamed of a separated ego, and you <em>have</em>\nbelieved in a world which rests upon it. This is very real to you. You\ncannot undo this by doing nothing and <em>not</em> changing.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> If you are willing to renounce the role of guardian[s] of your\nthought system[s] and open [them] to me, I will correct [them] very\ngently and lead you home. Every good teacher hopes to give his students\nso much of his own thinking that they will one day no longer need him.\nThis is the one real goal of the parent, teacher, and therapist. This\ngoal will not be achieved by those who believe that they will <em>lose</em> their\nchild or pupil or patient if they succeed. It is <em>impossible</em> to convince\nthe ego of this because it goes against all of its own laws. But\nremember that laws are set up to protect the continuity of the system in\nwhich the law-maker <em>believes</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> It is natural enough for the ego to try to protect itself once you\nhave made it, but it is <em>not</em> natural for <em>you</em> to want to obey its laws\nunless you believe in them. The ego cannot make this choice because of\nthe nature of its origin. <em>You</em> can because of the nature of <em>yours</em>. Egos\ncan clash in any situation, but Souls cannot clash at all. If you\nperceive a teacher as merely a “larger ego,” you <em>will</em> be afraid because\nto <em>enlarge</em> an ego <em>is</em> to increase separation anxiety. I will teach with\nyou and live with you if you will think with me, but my goal will always\nbe to absolve you finally from the <em>need</em> for a teacher.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> This is the <em>opposite</em> of the ego-oriented teacher’s goal. He is\nconcerned with the effect of <em>his</em> ego on <em>other</em> egos and therefore\ninterprets their interaction as a means of ego preservation. I would not\nbe able to devote myself to teaching if I believed this, and <em>you</em> will\nnot be a devoted teacher as long as <em>you</em> maintain it. I am constantly\nbeing perceived as a teacher either to be exalted or rejected, but I do\nnot accept either perception for myself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> Your worth is <em>not</em> established by your teaching <em>or</em> your learning. Your\nworth was established by God. As long as you dispute this, <em>everything</em>\nyou do will be fearful, particularly any situation which lends itself to\nthe “superiority-inferiority” fallacy. Teachers must be patient and\nrepeat their lessons until they are learned. I am willing to do this\nbecause I have no right to set your learning limits for you. Once\nagain—<em>nothing</em> you do or think or wish or make is necessary to establish\nyour worth. This point is not debatable except in delusions. Your ego is\n<em>never</em> at stake because God did <em>not</em> create it. Your Soul is never at\nstake because He <em>did</em>. <em>Any</em> confusion on this point is a delusion and no\nform of devotion is possible as long as this delusion lasts.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> The ego tries to exploit <em>all</em> situations into forms of praise for\nitself in order to overcome its doubts. It will be doubtful forever, or\nrather as long as you believe in it. You who made it <em>cannot</em> trust it\nbecause you <em>know</em> it is not real. The only <em>sane</em> solution is not to try to\nchange reality, which is indeed a fearful attempt, but to see it as it\n<em>is</em>. <em>You</em> are part of reality, which stands unchanged beyond the reach of\nyour ego but within easy reach of your Soul. When you are afraid, be\nstill and <em>know</em> that God is real and <em>you</em> are His beloved Son in whom He\nis well pleased. Do not let your ego dispute this because the ego cannot\nknow what is as far beyond its reach as you are.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> God is <em>not</em> the author of fear. <em>You</em> are. You have chosen, therefore,\nto create unlike Him, and you have made fear for yourselves. You are not\nat peace because you are not fulfilling your function. God gave you a\nvery lofty responsibility which you are not meeting. You <em>know</em> this, and\nyou are afraid. In fact, your egos have chosen to be afraid <em>instead</em> of\nmeeting it. When you awaken you will not be able to understand this\nbecause it is literally incredible. <em>Do not believe the incredible now</em>.\nAny attempt to increase its believability is merely to postpone the\ninevitable.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> The word “inevitable” is fearful to the ego but joyous to the Soul.\nGod <em>is</em> inevitable, and you <em>cannot</em> avoid Him any more than He can avoid\n<em>you</em>. The ego is afraid of the Soul’s joy because, once you have\nexperienced it, you will withdraw all protection from the ego and become\ntotally without the investment in fear. Your investment is great now\nbecause fear is a witness to the separation, and your ego rejoices when\nyou witness to it. Leave it behind! Do not listen to it, and do not\npreserve it. Listen only to God, Who is as incapable of deception as are\nthe Souls He created.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> Release yourselves and release others. Do not present a false and\nunworthy picture of yourself to others, and do not accept such a picture\nof them yourselves. The ego has built a shabby and unsheltering home for\nyou because it cannot build otherwise. Do not try to make this\nimpoverished house stand. <em>Its</em> weakness is <em>your</em> strength. Only God could\nmake a home that is worthy of His creations, who have chosen to leave it\nempty by their own dispossession. Yet His home will stand forever and is\nready for you when you choose to enter it. Of this you can be wholly\ncertain. God is as incapable of creating the perishable as the ego is of\nmaking the eternal.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> Of your egos you can do nothing to save yourselves or others, but of\nyour Souls you can do everything for the salvation of both. Humility is\na lesson for the ego, <em>not</em> for the Soul. The Soul is beyond humility\nbecause it recognizes its radiance and gladly sheds its light\neverywhere. The meek shall inherit the earth because their egos are\nhumble, and this gives them better perception. The Kingdom of Heaven is\nthe <em>right</em> of the Soul, whose beauty and dignity are far beyond doubt,\nbeyond perception, and stand forever as the mark of the Love of God for\nHis creations, who are wholly worthy of Him and <em>only</em> of Him. Nothing\nelse is sufficiently worthy to be a gift for a creation of God Himself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> I will substitute for your ego if you wish but <em>never</em> for your Soul. A\nfather can safely leave a child with an elder brother who has shown\nhimself responsible, but this involves no confusion about the child’s\norigin. The brother can protect the child’s body and his ego, which are\n<em>very</em> closely related, but he does not confuse <em>himself</em> with the father\nbecause he does this, although the child may. I can be entrusted with\nyour body and your ego simply because this enables you <em>not</em> to be\nconcerned with them and lets <em>me</em> teach you their unimportance. I could\nnot understand their importance to <em>you</em> if I had not once been tempted to\nbelieve in them myself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> Let us undertake to learn this lesson together, so we can be free of\nthem together. I need devoted teachers who share my aim of healing the\nmind. The Soul is far beyond the need of your protection or mine.\nRemember this:</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> <em>In this world you <strong>need</strong> not have tribulation <strong>because</strong><br />I\nhave overcome the world</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> <em>That</em> is why you should be of good cheer.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>24</sup> You have asked lately how the mind could ever have made the ego. This\nis a perfectly reasonable question; in fact, the best question you could\nask. There is, however, no point in giving an historical answer, because\nthe past does not matter in human terms, and history would not exist if\nthe same errors were not being repeated in the present. Abstract thought\napplies to knowledge, because knowledge is completely impersonal and\nexamples are irrelevant to its understanding. Perception, however, is\nalways specific and therefore quite concrete.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> Each man makes one ego for himself, although it is subject to\nenormous variation because of its instability, and one for everyone he\nperceives, which is equally variable. Their interaction is a process\nwhich literally alters both, because they were not made either <em>by</em> or\n<em>with</em> the unalterable. It is particularly important to realize that\nthis alteration can and does occur as readily when the interaction takes\nplace <em>in the mind</em> as when it involves physical presence. <em>Thinking</em>\nabout another ego is as effective in changing relative perception as is\nphysical interaction. There could be no better example of the fact that\nthe ego is an idea, though not a reality-based thought.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> Your own present state is a good example of how the mind made the\nego. You <em>do</em> have knowledge at times, but when you throw it away, it is\nas if you never had it. This willfulness is so apparent that one need\nonly perceive it to see that it <em>does</em> happen. If it can occur that way\nin the present, why is it surprising that it occurred that way in the\npast? Psychology rests on the principle of the continuity of behavior.\nSurprise is a reasonable response to the unfamiliar but hardly to\nsomething that has occurred with such persistence. I am using your\npresent state [as an example] of how the mind <em>can</em> work, provided you\nfully recognize that it <em>need</em> not work that way. Why are you surprised\nthat something happened in the dim past when it is so clearly happening\nright now?</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> You forget the love that animals have for their own offspring and\nthe need they feel to protect them. This is because they regard them as\npart of themselves. No one disowns something he regards as a very real\npart of himself. Man reacts to his ego much as God does to His Souls:\nwith love, protection, and great charity. The reaction of man to the\nself he made is not at all surprising. In fact it duplicates in many\nways how he will one day react to his <em>real</em> creations, which are as\ntimeless as he is. The question is not <em>how</em> man responds to his ego,\nbut what he believes he <em>is</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> Belief is an ego function, and as long as your origin is open to\nbelief at all, you <em>are</em> regarding it from an ego viewpoint. [That is\nwhy the Bible quotes me as saying “Ye believe in God, believe also in\nme.” Belief <em>does</em> apply to me, because I am the teacher of the ego.]\nWhen teaching is no longer necessary, you will merely <em>know</em> God.\nBelief that there <em>is</em> another way is the loftiest idea of which ego\nthinking is capable. That is because it contains a hint of recognition\nthat the ego is <em>not</em> the self. Undermining the ego’s thought system\n<em>must</em> be perceived as painful, even though this is anything but true.\nBabies scream in rage if you take away a knife or a scissors, even\nthough they may well harm themselves if you do not. The speed-up has\nplaced you in the same position.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> You are <em>not</em> prepared, and in this sense you <em>are</em> babies. You have\nno sense of real self-preservation and are very likely to decide that\nyou need precisely what would hurt you most. Whether you know it now or\nnot, however, you <em>have</em> willed to cooperate in a concerted and very\ncommendable effort to become both harm<em>less</em> and help<em>ful</em>, two\nattributes which <em>must</em> go together. Your attitudes, even toward this,\nare necessarily conflicted, because <em>all</em> attitudes are ego-based. This\nwill not last. Be patient awhile and remember that the outcome is as\ncertain as God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> Only those who have a real and lasting sense of abundance <em>can</em> be\ntruly charitable. This is quite obvious when you consider the concepts\ninvolved. To the ego, to give anything implies that you will do without\nit. When you associate giving with sacrifice, then, you give only\nbecause you believe that you are somehow getting something better so\nthat you can do without the thing you give. “Giving to get” is an\ninescapable law of the ego, which <em>always</em> evaluates itself in relation\nto other egos and is therefore continually preoccupied with the\nscarcity principle which gave rise to it. This is the meaning of\nFreud’s “reality principle” since Freud thought of the ego as very weak\nand deprived, capable of functioning <em>only</em> as a thing in need.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> The “reality principle” of the ego is not real at all. The ego is\nforced to perceive the “reality” of other egos because it cannot\nestablish the reality of <em>itself</em>. In fact, its whole perception of\nother egos <em>as</em> real is only an attempt to convince itself that <em>it</em> is\nreal. “Self esteem” in ego terms means nothing more than that the ego\nhas deluded itself into accepting its reality and is therefore\ntemporarily less predatory. This “self esteem” is <em>always</em> vulnerable\nto stress, a term which actually refers to a condition in which the\ndelusion of the ego’s reality is threatened. This produces either ego\ndeflation or ego inflation, resulting in either withdrawal or attack.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> The ego literally lives by comparisons. This means that equality is\nbeyond its grasp and charity becomes impossible. The ego <em>never</em> gives\nout of abundance, because it was made as a <em>substitute</em> for it. That is\nwhy the concept of “getting” arose in the ego’s thought system. All\nappetites are “getting” mechanisms, representing the ego’s need to\nconfirm itself. This is as true of bodily appetites as it is of the\nso-called “higher” ego needs. Bodily appetites are <em>not</em> physical in\norigin. The ego regards the body as its home and <em>does</em> try to satisfy\nitself through the body, but the <em>idea</em> that this is possible is a\ndecision of the ego, which is completely confused about what is\n<em>really</em> possible. This accounts for its erratic nature.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> The ego believes it is completely on its own, which is merely\nanother way of describing how it originated. This is such a fearful\nstate that it can only turn to other egos and try to unite with them in\na feeble attempt at identification or attack them in an equally feeble\nshow of strength. It is <em>not</em> free, however, to consider the validity\nof the premise itself, because this premise is its <em>foundation</em>. The\nego <em>is</em> the belief of the mind that it is completely on its own. Its\nceaseless attempts to gain the Soul’s acknowledgment and thus to\nestablish its own existence are utterly useless.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> The Soul in its knowledge is unaware of the ego. It does not attack\nit; it merely cannot conceive of it at all. While the ego is equally\nunaware of the Soul, it <em>does</em> perceive itself as rejected by\n“something” which is greater than itself. This is why self-esteem in\nego terms <em>must</em> be a delusion. The creations of God do not create\nmyths, although the creative efforts of man <em>can</em> turn to mythology. It\ncan do so, however, only under one condition; what man then makes is no\nlonger creative. Myths are entirely perceptions and are so ambiguous in\nform and so characteristically good and evil in nature that the most\nbenevolent of them is not without fearful components, if only by\ninnuendo.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> Myths and magic are closely associated in that myths are usually\nrelated to the ego origins and magic to the powers which the ego\nascribes to itself. Every mythological system includes some account of\n“the creation” and associates this with its particular perception of\nmagic. The “battle for survival” is nothing more than the ego’s\nstruggle to preserve itself and its interpretation of its own\nbeginning. This beginning is always associated with physical birth,\nbecause no one maintains that the ego existed before that point in\ntime. The religiously ego-oriented believe that the Soul existed before\nand will continue to exist afterwards, after a temporary lapse in ego\nlife. Some actually believe that the Soul will be punished for this\nlapse, even though in reality it could not possibly know anything about\nit.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> The term “salvation” does <em>not</em> apply to the Soul, which is not in\ndanger and does not need to be salvaged. Salvation is nothing more than\n“right-mindedness,” which is not the One-Mindedness of the Soul, but\nwhich must be accomplished before One-Mindedness can be restored.\nRight-mindedness dictates the next step automatically, because right\nperception is uniformly without attack, so that wrong-mindedness is\nobliterated. The ego cannot survive without judgment and is laid aside\naccordingly. The mind then has only <em>one</em> direction in which it can\nmove. The direction which the mind will take is always automatic,\nbecause it cannot <em>but</em> be dictated by the thought system to which the\nmind adheres.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> Every thought system has internal consistency, and this provides the\nbasis for the continuity of behavior. However, this is a matter of\nreliability and not validity. “Reliable behavior” is a meaningful\nperception as far as ego thinking goes. However, “valid behavior” is an\nexpression which is inherently contradictory, because validity is an\n<em>end</em> and behavior is a <em>means</em>. These cannot be combined logically,\nbecause when an end has been attained, the means for its attainment are\nno longer meaningful.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> A hypothesis is either false or true, to be accepted or rejected\naccordingly. If it is shown to be true, it becomes a fact, after which\nno one attempts to evaluate it unless its status <em>as</em> fact is\nquestioned. <em>Every</em> idea to which the ego has accorded the status of\nfact is questionable, because facts are in the realm of knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> Confusing realms of discourse is a thinking error which philosophers\nhave recognized for centuries. Psychologists are generally quite\ndeficient in this respect, as are many theologians. Data from one realm\nof discourse do not mean anything in another, because they can be\nunderstood only <em>within</em> the thought system of which they are a part.\nThat is why psychologists are concentrating increasingly on the ego in\nan attempt to unify their clearly unrelated data. It need hardly be\nsaid that an attempt to relate the unrelated <em>cannot</em> succeed.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> The more recent ecological emphases are but another ingenious way of\ntrying to impose order on chaos. We have already credited the ego with\nconsiderable ingenuity, though not with creativeness. It should,\nhowever, be remembered that inventiveness is really wasted effort, even\nin its most ingenious forms. We do not have to explain <em>anything</em>. This\nis why we need not trouble ourselves with inventiveness. The highly\nspecific nature of invention is not worthy of the abstract creativity\nof God’s creations.</p>\n\n",

Amen</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> That was written in that form because it is a good thing to use as a\nkind of a prayer in moments of temptation. It is a Declaration of\nIndependence. You will find it very helpful if you understand it fully.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> In its characteristically upside-down way, the ego has taken the\nimpulses from the superconscious and perceives them as if they arise in\nthe unconscious. The ego judges what is to be accepted, and the\nimpulses from the superconscious are unacceptable to it because they\nclearly point to the nonexistence of the ego itself. The ego therefore\nexperiences threat and not only censors but also reinterprets the data.\nHowever, as Freud correctly pointed out, what you have repressed can\nretain a very active life <em>beyond</em> your awareness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> Repression thus operates to conceal not only the baser impulses but\nalso the most lofty ones from awareness because <em>both</em> are threatening\nto the ego and, being concerned primarily with its own preservation in\nthe face of threat, the ego perceives them <em>as the same</em>. The\nthreat-value of the lofty is actually much greater to the ego because\nthe pull of God Himself can hardly be equated with the pull of human\nappetites. By perceiving them <em>as</em> the same, the ego attempts to save\nitself from being swept away, as it would surely <em>be</em> in the presence\nof knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> The upper level of the unconscious thus contains the Call of God as\nwell as the call of the body. That is why the basic conflict between\nlove and fear is unconscious; the ego cannot tolerate either and\nrepresses both by resorting to inhibition. Society depends on\ninhibiting the latter, but <em>salvation</em> depends on <em>dis</em>inhibiting the\nformer. The reason you need <em>my</em> help is because you have repressed\nyour own Guide and therefore need guidance. My role is to separate the\ntrue from the false in your unconscious so it can break through the\nbarriers the ego has set up and shine into your minds. Against our\nunited strength, the ego <em>cannot</em> prevail.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> It should be apparent to you by now why the ego regards the Soul as\nits “enemy.” The ego arose from the separation, and its continued\nexistence depends on <em>your</em> continuing belief in the separation. Having\nreduced the Soul impulses to the unconscious, the ego has to offer you\nsome sort of reward for maintaining this belief. All it <em>can</em> offer is\na sense of temporary existence, which begins with its <em>own</em> beginning\nand ends with its <em>own</em> ending. It tells you this life is <em>your</em>\nexistence because it <em>is</em> its own. Against this sense of temporary\nexistence the Soul offers you the knowledge of permanence and\nunshakable <em>being</em>. No one who has experienced the revelation of <em>this</em>\ncan ever fully believe in the ego again. How can its meager offering to\nyou prevail against the glorious gift of God?</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> You who identify <em>with</em> your egos cannot believe that God loves you.\n<em>You</em> do not love what you have made, and what you made does not love\n<em>you</em>. Being made out of the denial of the Father, the ego has no\nallegiance to its own maker. You cannot conceive of the real\nrelationship which exists between God and His Souls because of the\nhatred you have for the self <em>you</em> have made. You project onto your\n<em>own</em> idea of yourself the will to separate, which conflicts with the\nlove you feel for what you made <em>because</em> you made it. No human love is\nwithout this ambivalence, and since no ego has experienced love\n<em>without</em> ambivalence, the concept is beyond its understanding.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> Love will enter immediately into <em>any</em> mind which truly wants it,\nbut it <em>must</em> want it truly. This means that it wants it <em>without</em>\nambivalence, and this kind of wanting is wholly without the ego’s\n“drive to get.” There is a kind of experience which is so different\nfrom anything the ego can offer that you will never recover. The word\n“recover” is used quite literally here—you will never be able to cover\nor hide again. It is necessary to repeat here that your belief in\ndarkness and in hiding <em>is</em> why the light cannot enter. The Bible gives\nmany references to the immeasurable gifts which are <em>for</em> you but for\nwhich <em>you</em> must ask. This is not a condition as the ego sets\nconditions. It is the glorious condition of what you <em>are</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> No force except your own will is strong enough or worthy enough to\nguide you. In this you are as free as God and must remain so forever.\nYou can never be bound except in honor, and that is always voluntary.\nLet us ask the Father in my name to keep you mindful of His love for\nyou and yours for Him. He has never failed to answer this request\nbecause it asks only for what He has already willed. Those who call\ntruly are <em>always</em> answered. Thou shalt have no other gods before Him\nbecause there <em>are</em> none.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> It has never really entered your mind to give up every idea you ever\nhad that <em>opposes</em> knowledge. You retain thousands of little scraps of\nmeanness which prevent the Holy One from entering. Light cannot\npenetrate through the walls you make to block it, and it is forever\nunwilling to destroy what you have made. No one can see <em>through</em> a\nwall, but <em>I</em> can step around it. Watch your minds for the scraps of\nmeanness or you will be unable to ask me to do so. I can help you only\nas our Father created us. I will love you and honor you and maintain\ncomplete respect for what you have made, but I will neither honor it\nnor love it unless it is true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> I will never forsake you any more than God will, but I <em>must</em> wait\nas long as you choose to forsake yourself. Because I wait in love and\nnot in impatience, you will surely ask me truly. I will come in\nresponse to a single unequivocal call. Watch carefully and see what it\nis you are really asking for. Be very honest with yourself about this,\nfor we must hide nothing from each other. If you will really try to do\nthis, you have taken the first step toward preparing your mind for the\nHoly One to enter. We will prepare for this together, for once He has\ncome, you will be ready to help me make other minds ready for Him. How\nlong will you deny Him His Kingdom?</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> In your own unconscious, deeply repressed by the ego, is the\ndeclaration of your release. <em>God has given you everything</em>. This is\nthe one fact that means the ego does not exist and which therefore\nmakes it profoundly afraid. In the ego’s language, remember, “to have”\nand “to be” are different, but they are identical to the Soul. The Soul\nknows that you both <em>have</em> everything and <em>are</em> everything. Any\ndistinction in this respect is meaningful only when the idea of\n“getting,” which implies a lack, has <em>already</em> been accepted. That is\nwhy we made no distinction before between <em>having</em> the Kingdom of God\nand <em>being</em> the Kingdom of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> The calm being of God’s Kingdom, which in your sane mind is\nperfectly conscious, is ruthlessly banished from the part of the mind\nwhich the ego rules. The ego is desperate because it opposes literally\ninvincible odds, whether you are asleep or awake. Consider how much\nvigilance you have been willing to exert to protect your ego and how\nlittle you have been willing to expend to protect your higher mind. Who\nbut the insane would undertake to believe what is not true and then\nprotect this belief at the <em>cost</em> of truth?</p>\n\n",

The fact that you <em>do</em> listen to the voice of your ego is\ndemonstrated by your attitudes, your feelings, and your behavior. Your\nattitudes are obviously conflicted, your feelings have a narrow range on\nthe negative side but are never purely joyous, and your behavior is\neither strained or unpredictable. Yet this is what you <em>want</em>. This is\nwhat you are fighting to keep and what you are vigilant to save. Your\nminds are filled with schemes to save the face of your egos, and you do\nnot seek the Face of God. The glass in which the ego seeks to see its\nface is dark indeed. How can it maintain the trick of its existence\nexcept with mirrors? But where <em>you</em> look to find yourself is up to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> We have said that you cannot change your mind by changing your\nbehavior, but we have also said, and many times before, that you <em>can</em>\nchange your mind. When your mood tells you that you have chosen wrongly,\nand this is so whenever you are not joyous, then <em>know</em> this need not\nbe. In every case you have thought wrongly about some Soul that God\ncreated and are perceiving images your ego makes in a darkened glass.\nThink honestly what you have thought that God would <em>not</em> have thought\nand what you have <em>not</em> thought that God would have you think. Search\nsincerely for what you have done and left undone accordingly, and then\nchange your minds <em>to think with God’s</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> This may seem hard to you, but it is much easier than trying to think\n<em>against</em> it. Your mind <em>is</em> one with God’s. Denying this and thinking\notherwise has held your ego together but has literally split your mind.\nAs a loving brother, I am deeply concerned with your mind and urge you\nto follow my example as you look at yourselves and at each other and see\nin both the glorious creations of a glorious Father.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> When you are sad, <em>know that this need not be</em>. Depression <em>always</em>\narises ultimately from a sense of being deprived of something you want\nand do not have. <em>Know</em> you are deprived of nothing except by your own\ndecisions, and then decide otherwise.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> When you are anxious, <em>know</em> that all anxiety comes from the\ncapriciousness of the ego <em>and need not be</em>. You can be as vigilant\n<em>against</em> the ego’s dictates as <em>for</em> them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> When you feel guilty, <em>know</em> that the ego has indeed violated the\nlaws of God, but <em>you</em> have not. Leave the sins of the ego to me. That\nis what Atonement is for. But until you change your mind about those\nyour ego has hurt, the Atonement cannot release you. As long as you feel\nguilty, your ego is in command because only the ego <em>can</em> experience\nguilt. <em>This need not be</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> Watch your mind for the temptations of the ego and do not be deceived\nby it. <em>Know</em> it offers you nothing. When you have given up this\nvoluntary dispiriting, you will see how your mind can focus and rise\nabove fatigue and heal. Yet you are not sufficiently vigilant <em>against</em>\nthe demands of the ego to disengage yourself. <em>This need not be</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> The habit of engaging <em>with</em> God and His creations is easily made if\nyou actively refuse to let your minds slip away. The problem is <em>not</em>\none of concentration; it is the belief that no one, including yourself,\nis <em>worth</em> consistent effort. Side with me <em>consistently</em> against this\ndeception, and do not permit this shabby belief to pull you back. The\ndisheartened are useless to themselves and to me, but only the ego can\n<em>be</em> disheartened. Have you <em>really</em> considered how many opportunities\nyou have to gladden yourselves and how many of them you have refused?\nThere is no limit to the power of a Son of God, but he himself can limit\nthe expression of his power as much as he chooses.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> Your mind and mine can unite in shining your ego away and releasing\nthe strength of God into everything you think and will and do. Do not\nsettle for anything <em>less</em> than this, and refuse to accept anything\n<em>but</em> this as your goal. Watch your minds carefully for <em>any</em> beliefs\nthat hinder its accomplishment, and step away from them. Judge how well\nyou have done this by your own feelings, for this is the one <em>right</em> use\nof judgment. Judgment, like any other defense, can be used to attack or\nprotect, to hurt or to heal. The ego <em>should</em> be brought to your\njudgment and found wanting there. Without your own allegiance,\nprotection, and love, it cannot exist. Judge your ego truly, and you\n<em>must</em> withdraw allegiance, protection, and love from it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> You are mirrors of truth in which God Himself shines in perfect\nlight. To the ego’s dark glass you need but say, “I will not look there\nbecause I <em>know</em> these images are not true.” Then let the Holy One shine\non you in peace, knowing that this and <em>only</em> this must be. His Mind\nshone on you in your creation and brought <em>your</em> mind into being. His\nMind still shines on you and must shine <em>through</em> you. Your ego cannot\nprevent <em>Him</em> from shining on you, but it <em>can</em> prevent you from letting\nHim shine <em>through</em> you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> The first coming of Christ is just another name for the creation, for\nChrist is the Son of God. The <em>second</em> coming of Christ means nothing\nmore than the end of the ego’s rule over part of the minds of men and\nthe healing of the mind. I was created like you in the first, and I have\ncalled you to join with me in the second. If you will think over your\nlives, you will see how carefully the preparations were made. I am in\ncharge of the second coming, and my judgment, which is used only for\nprotection, cannot be wrong because it <em>never</em> attacks. <em>Yours</em> is so\ndistorted that you believe I was mistaken in choosing you. I assure you\nthis is a mistake of your egos. Do <em>not</em> mistake it for humility.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> Your egos are trying to convince you that <em>they</em> are real and <em>I</em> am\nnot because, if <em>I</em> am real, I am no more real than <em>you</em> are. That\nknowledge, and I assure you that it <em>is</em> knowledge, means that Christ\nmust come into your minds and heal them. Although I am <em>not</em> attacking\nyour egos, I <em>am</em> working with your higher mind whether you are asleep\nor awake, just as your ego does with your lower mind. I am your\nvigilance in this, because you are too confused to recognize your own\nhope. I was <em>not</em> mistaken. Your minds <em>will</em> elect to join with mine,\nand together we are invincible.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> You will yet come together in my name, and your sanity will be\nrestored. I raised the dead by <em>knowing</em> that life is an eternal\nattribute of everything that the living God created. Why do you believe\nit is harder for me to inspire the dispirited or to stabilize the\nunstable? <em>I</em> do not believe that there is an order of difficulty in\nmiracles; <em>you</em> do. I have called, and you will answer. I <em>know</em> that\nmiracles are natural because they are expressions of love. My calling\nyou is as natural as your answer and as inevitable.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>69</sup> <em>All</em> things work together for good. There are <em>no</em> exceptions except\nin the ego’s judgment. Control is a central factor in what the ego\npermits into consciousness and one to which it devotes its maximum\nvigilance. This is <em>not</em> the way a balanced mind holds together. <em>Its</em>\ncontrol is unconscious. The ego is further off balance by keeping its\nprimary <em>motivation</em> unconscious and raising control rather than\nsensible judgment to predominance. The ego has every reason to do this\naccording to the thought system which gave rise to it and which it\nserves. Sane judgment would inevitably judge <em>against</em> the ego and must\nbe obliterated <em>by</em> the ego in the interest of its self-preservation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> A major source of the ego’s off-balanced state is its lack of\ndiscrimination between impulses from God and from the body. Any thought\nsystem which makes this confusion <em>must</em> be insane. Yet this demented\nstate is <em>essential</em> to the ego, which judges only in terms of threat or\nnon-threat <em>to itself</em>. In one sense the ego’s fear of the idea of God\nis at least logical, since this idea <em>does</em> dispel the ego. Fear of\ndissolution from the Higher Source, then, makes <em>some</em> sense in\nego-terms. But fear of the body, with which the ego identifies so\nclosely, is more blatantly senseless.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> The body is the ego’s home by its own election. It is the only\nidentification with which the ego feels safe, because the body’s\nvulnerability is its own best argument that you <em>cannot</em> be of God. This\nis the belief that the ego sponsors eagerly. Yet the ego hates the body\nbecause it does not accept the idea that the body is <em>good</em> enough to be\nits home. Here is where the mind becomes actually dazed. Being told by\nthe ego that it is really part of the body and that the body is its\nprotector, the mind is also constantly informed that the body can <em>not</em>\nprotect it. This, of course, is not only accurate but perfectly obvious.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> Therefore the mind asks, “Where can I go for protection?” to which\nthe ego replies, “Turn to me.” The mind, and not without cause, reminds\nthe ego that it has itself insisted that it <em>is</em> identified with the\nbody, so there is no point in turning to it for protection. The ego has\nno real answer to this because there <em>is</em> none, but it <em>does</em> have a\ntypical solution. It obliterates the <em>question</em> from the mind’s\nawareness. Once unconscious, the question can and does produce\nuneasiness, but it cannot be answered because it cannot be <em>asked</em>. This\nis the question which <em>must</em> be asked: “Where am I to go for\nprotection?” Even the insane ask it unconsciously, but it requires real\nsanity to ask it consciously.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> When the Bible says, “Seek and ye shall find,” it does not mean that\nyou should seek blindly and desperately for something you would not\nrecognize. Meaningful seeking is consciously undertaken, consciously\norganized, and consciously directed. The goal must be formulated clearly\n<em>and kept in mind</em>. As a teacher with some experience, let me remind you\nthat learning and <em>wanting</em> to learn are inseparable. All learners learn\nbest when they believe that what they are trying to learn is of <em>value</em>\nto them. However, values in this world are hierarchical, and not\neverything you may want to learn has lasting value.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> Indeed, many of the things you want to learn are chosen <em>because</em>\ntheir value will not last. The ego thinks it is an advantage not to\ncommit itself to <em>anything</em> that is eternal because the eternal <em>must</em>\ncome from God. Eternalness is the one function which the ego has tried\nto develop but has systematically failed. It may surprise you to learn\nthat had the ego wished to do so it could have made the eternal because,\nas a product of the mind, it <em>is</em> endowed with the power of its own\ncreator. However, the <em>decision</em> to do this, rather than the ability to\ndo it, is what the ego cannot tolerate. That is because the decision,\nfrom which the ability would naturally develop, would necessarily\ninvolve accurate perception, a state of clarity which the ego, fearful\nof being judged truly, <em>must</em> avoid.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> The results of this dilemma are peculiar, but no more so than the\ndilemma itself. The ego has reacted characteristically here as elsewhere\nbecause mental illness, which is <em>always</em> a form of ego involvement, is\nnot a matter of reliability as much as of validity. The ego compromises\nwith the issue of the eternal, just as it does with all issues that\ntouch on the real question in any way. By compromising in connection\nwith all <em>tangential</em> questions, it hopes to hide the real question <em>and\nkeep it out of mind</em>. The ego’s characteristic busyness with\nnon-essentials is for precisely that purpose.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> Consider the alchemist’s age-old attempts to turn base metal into\ngold. The one question which the alchemist did not permit himself to ask\nwas, “What <em>for</em>?” He could not ask this because it would immediately\nbecome apparent that there was no sense in his efforts even if he\nsucceeded. If gold became more plentiful, its value would decrease, and\nhis own purpose would be defeated. The ego has countenanced some strange\ncompromises with the idea of the eternal, making many odd attempts to\nrelate the concept to the <em>un</em>important in an effort to satisfy the mind\nwithout jeopardizing itself. Thus, it has permitted minds to devote\nthemselves to the possibility of perpetual <em>motion</em>, but <em>not</em> to\nperpetual thoughts.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> Ideational preoccupations with problems set up to be incapable of\nsolution are also favorite ego devices for impeding the strong-willed\nfrom making real learning progress. The problems of squaring the circle\nand carrying pi to infinity are good examples. A more recent ego attempt\nis particularly noteworthy. The idea of preserving the <em>body</em> by\nsuspension, thus giving it the kind of limited immortality which the ego\ncan tolerate, is among its more recent appeals to the mind. It is\nnoticeable, however, that in all these diversionary tactics, the one\nquestion which is <em>never</em> asked by those who pursue them is, “What\n<em>for</em>?”</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> This is the question which <em>you</em> must learn to ask in connection with\n<em>everything</em> your mind wishes to undertake. What is the purpose?\nWhatever it is, you cannot doubt that it will channelize your efforts\nautomatically. When you make a decision of purpose, then, you have made\na decision about your future effort, a decision which will remain in\neffect unless you change the <em>decision</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> Psychologists are in a good position to realize that the ego is\ncapable of making and accepting as real some very distorted\nassociations. The confusion of sex with aggression and the resulting\nbehavior, which is perceived as the same for both, serves as an example.\nThis is “understandable” to the psychologist and does not produce\nsurprise. The lack of surprise, however, is <em>not</em> a sign of\nunderstanding. It is a symptom of the psychologist’s ability to accept\nas reasonable a compromise which is clearly senseless—to attribute it to\nthe mental illness of the patient rather than his own and to limit his\nquestions about both the patient <em>and</em> himself to the trivial.</p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> Such relatively minor confusions of the ego are not among its more\nprofound misassociations, although they do reflect them. Your egos have\nbeen blocking the more important questions which your minds <em>should</em>\nask. You do not understand a patient while you yourselves are willing to\nlimit the questions you raise about <em>his</em> mind because you are also\naccepting these limits for <em>yours</em>. This makes you unable to heal him\n<em>and</em> yourselves. Be always unwilling to adapt to <em>any</em> situation in\nwhich miracle-mindedness is unthinkable. That state in itself is enough\nto demonstrate that the perception is wrong.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>81</sup> It cannot be emphasized too often that correcting perception is\nmerely a temporary expedient. It is necessary to do so only because\nmisperception is a block to knowledge, while accurate perception is a\nstepping-stone <em>towards</em> it. The whole value of right perception lies in\nthe inevitable judgment which it entails that it <em>is</em> unnecessary. This\nremoves the block entirely. You may ask how this is possible as long as\nyou appear to be living in this world, and since this is a sensible\nquestion, it has a sensible answer. You must be careful, however, that\nyou really understand the question. What <em>is</em> the “you” who are living\nin this world?</p>\n\n<p><sup>82</sup> Immortality is a constant state. It is as true now as it ever was or\never will be because it implies <em>no change at all</em>. It is not a\ncontinuum nor is it understood by being compared to an opposite.\nKnowledge never involves comparisons. That is its essential difference\nfrom everything else the mind can grasp. “A little knowledge” is not\ndangerous except to the ego. Vaguely it senses threat, and being unable\nto realize that “a little knowledge” is a meaningless phrase since “all”\nand “a little” in this context are the same, the ego decides that, since\n“all” is impossible, the fear does not lie there. “A little,” however,\nis a scarcity concept, and <em>this</em> the ego understands well. “A little,”\nthen, is perceived as the real threat.</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> The essential thing to remember is that the ego <em>does not recognize</em>\nthe real source of its perceived threat, and if <em>you</em> associate yourself\nwith the ego, <em>you</em> do not perceive the whole situation as it is. Only\nyour allegiance to it gives the ego <em>any</em> power over you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>84</sup> We have spoken of the ego as if it were a separate thing acting on\nits own. This was necessary to persuade you that you cannot dismiss it\nlightly and must realize how much of your thinking is ego-directed. We\ncannot safely let it go at that, however, or you will regard yourselves\nas necessarily conflicted as long as you are here, or more properly, as\nlong as you <em>believe</em> that you are here.</p>\n\n<p><sup>85</sup> The ego is nothing more than a <em>part</em> of your belief about\nyourselves. Your other life has continued without interruption and has\nbeen and always will be totally unaffected by your attempts to\ndissociate. The ratio of repression and dissociation varies with the\nindividual ego-illusion, but dissociation is always involved or you\nwould not believe that you <em>are</em> here. In learning to escape from the\nillusions you have made, your great debt to each other is something you\nmust never forget. It is exactly the same debt that you owe to me.\nWhenever you react egotistically towards each other, you are throwing\naway the graciousness of your indebtedness and the holy perception it\nwould produce.</p>\n\n<p><sup>86</sup> The term “holy” can be used here because as you learn how much you\n<em>are</em> indebted to the whole Sonship, which <em>includes</em> me, you come as\nclose to knowledge as perception ever can. The gap is then so small that\nknowledge can easily flow across it and obliterate it forever. You have\nvery little trust in me as yet, but it will increase as you turn more\nand more often to me <em>instead</em> of your egos for guidance. The results\nwill convince you increasingly that your choice in turning to me is the\nonly sane one you can make. No one who has learned from experience that\none choice brings peace and joy while another brings chaos and disaster\nneeds much conditioning.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> The ego cannot withstand the conditioning process because the process\nitself <em>demonstrates</em> that there is another way. Conditioning by rewards\nhas always been more effective than conditioning by pain because pain is\nan ego-illusion and can never induce more than a temporary effect. The\nrewards of God, however, are immediately recognized as eternal. Since\nthis recognition is made by you and <em>not</em> the ego, the recognition\n<em>itself</em> establishes that you and your ego <em>cannot</em> be identical. You\nmay believe that you have already accepted the difference, but you are\nby no means convinced as yet. The very fact that you are preoccupied\nwith the idea of escaping <em>from</em> the ego shows this.</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> You <em>cannot</em> escape from the ego by humbling it or controlling it or\npunishing it. Remember that the ego and the Soul <em>do not know</em> each\nother. The separated mind cannot maintain the separation <em>except</em> by\ndissociating. Having done this, it utilizes repression against all truly\nnatural impulses, not because the <em>ego</em> is a separate thing, but because\nyou want to believe that <em>you</em> are. The ego is a device for maintaining\nthis belief, but it is still only <em>your</em> willingness to use the device\nthat enables it to endure.</p>\n\n<p><sup>89</sup> My trust in you is greater than yours in me at the moment, but it\nwill not always be that way. Your mission is very simple. You have been\nchosen to live so as to demonstrate that you are <em>not</em> an ego. I repeat\nthat I do not choose God’s channels wrongly. The Holy One shares my\ntrust and always approves my Atonement decisions because my will is\nnever out of accord with His. I have told you before that I am in charge\nof the whole Atonement. This is <em>only</em> because I completed my part in it\nas a man and can now complete it through other men. My chosen receiving\nand sending channels cannot fail because I will lend them <em>my</em> strength\nas long as theirs is wanting.</p>\n\n<p><sup>90</sup> I will go with you to the Holy One, and through <em>my</em> perception, <em>He</em>\ncan bridge the little gap. Your gratitude to <em>each other</em> is the only\ngift I want. I will bring it to God for you, knowing that to know your\nbrother <em>is</em> to know God. A little knowledge is an all-encompassing\nthing. If you are grateful to each other, you are grateful to God for\nwhat He created. Through your gratitude, you can come to know each\nother, and one moment of real recognition makes all men your brothers\nbecause they are all of your Father. Love does not conquer all things,\nbut it <em>does</em> set all things right. Because you are all the Kingdom of\nGod, I can lead you back to your own creations, which you do not yet\nknow. What has been dissociated is still there.</p>\n\n<p><sup>91</sup> As you come closer to a brother, you <em>do</em> approach me and, as you\nwithdraw from him, <em>I</em> become distant to you. Your giant step forward\nwas to insist on a “collaborative venture.” This does not go against the\ntrue spirit of meditation; it is inherent in it. Meditation is a\ncollaborative venture with God. It <em>cannot</em> be undertaken successfully\nby those who disengage themselves from the Sonship because they are\ndisengaging themselves from me. God will come to you <em>only</em> as you will\ngive Him to your brothers. Learn first of them, and you will be ready to\nhear God as you hear them. That is because the function of love is one.</p>\n\n<p><sup>92</sup> How can you teach someone the value of something he has deliberately\nthrown away? He must have thrown it away because he did not value it.\nYou can only show him how miserable he is without it and bring it near\nvery slowly, so he can learn how his misery lessens as he approaches it.\nThis conditions him to associate his misery with its absence and to\nassociate the opposite of misery with its presence. It gradually becomes\ndesirable as he changes his mind about its worth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>93</sup> I am conditioning you to associate misery with the ego and joy with\nthe Soul. You have conditioned yourselves the other way around. A far\ngreater reward, however, will break through any conditioning if it is\nrepeatedly offered whenever the old habit pattern is broken. You are\nstill free to choose, but can you really <em>want</em> the rewards of the ego\nin the presence of the rewards of God?</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>94</sup> It should be clear by now that, while the content of any particular\nego-illusion does not matter, it is usually more helpful to correct it\nin a specific context. Ego-illusions are <em>quite</em> specific, although they\nfrequently change and although the mind is naturally abstract. The mind\nnevertheless becomes concrete voluntarily as soon as it splits. However,\nonly <em>part</em> of it splits, so only <em>part</em> of it is concrete. The concrete\npart is the same part that believes in the ego because the ego <em>depends</em>\non the specific. It is the part that believes your existence means you\nare <em>separate</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>95</sup> Everything the ego perceives is a separate whole, without the\nrelationships that imply <em>being</em>. The ego is thus <em>against</em>\ncommunication except in so far as it is utilized to <em>establish</em>\nseparateness rather than to abolish it. The communication system of the\nego is based on its own thought system, as is everything else it\ndictates. Its communication is controlled by its need to protect itself,\nand it will disrupt communication when it experiences threat. While this\nis always so, individual egos perceive different kinds of threat which\nare quite specific in their own judgment. For example, although all\nforms of perceived demands may be classified or judged by the ego as\ncoercive communication which must be disrupted, the response of breaking\ncommunication will nevertheless be to a <em>specific</em> person or persons.</p>\n\n<p><sup>96</sup> The specificity of the ego’s thinking, then, results in a spurious\nkind of generalization which is really not abstract at all. It will\nrespond in certain specific ways to <em>all</em> stimuli which it perceives as\nrelated. In contrast the Soul reacts in the same way to everything it\nknows is true and does not respond at all to anything else. Nor does it\nmake any attempt to <em>establish</em> what is true. It knows that what is true\nis everything that God created. It is in complete and direct\ncommunication with every aspect of creation because it is in complete\nand direct communication with its Creator.</p>\n\n<p><sup>97</sup> <em>This</em> communication <em>is</em> the Will of God. Creation and communication\nare synonymous. God created every mind by communicating His Mind to it,\nthus establishing it forever as a channel for the reception of His Mind\nand Will. Since only beings of a like order can truly communicate, His\ncreations naturally communicate <em>with</em> Him and <em>like</em> Him. This\ncommunication is perfectly abstract in that its quality is universal in\napplication and not subject to <em>any</em> judgment, <em>any</em> exception, or <em>any</em>\nalteration. God created you <em>by</em> this and <em>for</em> this. The mind can\ndistort its function, but it cannot endow itself with functions it was\nnot given. That is why the mind cannot totally lose the ability to\ncommunicate, even though it may refuse to utilize it on behalf of being.</p>\n\n<p><sup>98</sup> Existence as well as being rests on communication. Existence,\nhowever, is <em>specific</em> in how, what, and with whom communication is\njudged to be worth undertaking. Being is completely without these\ndistinctions. It is a state in which the mind <em>is</em> in communication with\neverything that is real, including the Soul. To whatever extent you\npermit this state to be curtailed, you are limiting your sense of your\n<em>own</em> reality, which becomes total only by your recognizing <em>all</em>\nreality in the glorious context of its <em>real</em> relationship to you. This\n<em>is</em> your reality. Do not desecrate it or recoil from it. It is your\nreal home, your real temple, and your real Self.</p>\n\n<p><sup>99</sup> God, Who encompasses <em>all</em> being, nevertheless created beings who\nhave everything individually but who want to share it to increase their\njoy. Nothing that is real can be increased <em>except</em> by sharing. That is\nwhy God Himself created you. Divine Abstraction takes joy in\napplication, and that is what creation <em>means</em>. “How,” “what,” and “to\nwhom” are irrelevant because real creation gives everything, since it\ncan create <em>only</em> like itself. Remember that in being there is no\ndifference between “having” and “being” as there is in existence. In the\nstate of being, the mind gives everything always.</p>\n\n<p><sup>100</sup> The Bible repeatedly states that you should praise God. This hardly\nmeans that you should tell Him how wonderful He is. He has no ego with\nwhich to accept such thanks and no perception with which to judge such\nofferings. But unless you take your part in the creation, His joy is not\ncomplete because <em>yours</em> is incomplete. And <em>this</em> He does know. He\nknows it in His own Being and its experience of His Son’s experience.\nThe constant <em>going out</em> of His love is blocked when His channels are\nclosed, and He <em>is</em> lonely when the minds He created do not communicate\nfully with Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>101</sup> God <em>has</em> kept your kingdom for you, but He cannot share His joy\nwith you until you know it with your whole mind. Even revelation is not\nenough because it is communication <em>from</em> God. It is not enough until it\nis <em>shared</em>. God does not need revelation returned to Him, which would\nclearly be impossible, but He <em>does</em> want revelation brought to others.\nThis cannot be done with the actual revelation because its content\ncannot be expressed, and it is intensely personal to the mind which\nreceives it. It can, however, still be returned <em>by</em> that mind through\nits attitudes to <em>other</em> minds which the knowledge from the revelation\nbrings.</p>\n\n<p><sup>102</sup> God is praised whenever any mind learns to be wholly helpful. This\nis impossible without being wholly harmless because the two beliefs\ncoexist. The truly helpful are invulnerable because they are <em>not</em>\nprotecting their egos, so that nothing <em>can</em> hurt them. Their\nhelpfulness <em>is</em> their praise of God, and He will return their praise of\nHim because they are like Him, and they can rejoice together. God goes\nout to them and through them, and there is great joy throughout the\nKingdom. Every mind that is changed adds to this joy with its own\nindividual willingness to share in it. The truly helpful are God’s\nmiracle workers whom I direct until we are all united in the joy of the\nKingdom. I will direct you to wherever you can be truly helpful and to\nwhoever can follow my guidance through you.</p>\n\n",

The “team” approach generally leads more\nto confusion than to anything else because it is too often misused as a\nway of exerting the ego’s domination over other egos, rather than as a\nreal experiment in the cooperation of minds. Rehabilitation as a\nmovement is an improvement over the overt neglect of those in need of\nhelp, but it is often little more than a painful attempt on the part of\nthe halt to lead the blind.</p>\n\n<p><sup>104</sup> The ego is likely to fear broken bodies because it cannot tolerate\nthem. The ego cannot tolerate ego weakness either without ambivalence\nbecause it is afraid of its own weakness as well as the weakness of its\nchosen home. When it is threatened, the ego blocks your natural impulse\nto help, placing you under the strain of divided will. You may then be\ntempted to withdraw to allow your ego to recover and to gain enough\nstrength to be helpful again on a basis limited enough <em>not</em> to threaten\nyour ego but too limited to give <em>you</em> joy. Those with broken bodies are\noften looked down on by the ego because of its belief that nothing but a\nperfect body is worthy as its <em>own</em> temple.</p>\n\n<p><sup>105</sup> A mind that recoils from a hurt body is in great need of\nrehabilitation itself. <em>All</em> symptoms of hurt need true helpfulness, and\nwhenever they are met with this, the mind that so meets them heals\n<em>itself</em>. Rehabilitation is an attitude of praising God as He Himself\nknows praise. He offers praise to you, and you must offer it to others.\nThe chief handicaps of the clinicians lie in their attitudes to those\nwhom their egos perceive as weakened and damaged. <em>By</em> these\nevaluations, they have weakened and damaged their own helpfulness and\nhave thus set their own rehabilitation back. Rehabilitation is <em>not</em>\nconcerned either with the ego’s fight for control or its need to avoid\nand withdraw. You can do much on behalf of your own rehabilitation <em>and</em>\nthat of others if in a situation calling for healing you think of it\nthis way:</p>\n\n<p><sup>106</sup> <em>I am here <strong>only</strong> to be truly helpful.<br />\nI am here to represent Christ, Who sent me.<br />\nI do <strong>not</strong> have to worry about what to say or what to do<br />\nbecause He Who sent me will direct me.<br />\nI am content to be wherever He wishes, knowing He goes there with me.<br />\nI will be healed as I let Him teach me to heal</em>.</p>\n\n",

This is exactly the same as telling you that you have refused\nto heal yourselves. The light that belongs to you is the light of joy.\nRadiance is not associated with sorrow. Depression is often contagious\nbut, although it may affect those who come in contact with it, they do\nnot yield to the influence whole-heartedly. But joy calls forth an\nintegrated willingness to share in it and thus promotes the mind’s\nnatural impulse <em>to respond as one</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> Those who attempt to heal without being wholly joyous themselves call\nforth different kinds of responses at the same time and thus deprive\nothers of the joy of responding whole-heartedly.

    "content": "<p><sup>5</sup> Healing is an act of thought by which two minds perceive their oneness\nand become glad. This gladness calls to every part of the Sonship to\nrejoice with them and lets God Himself go out into them and through\nthem. Only the healed mind can experience revelation with lasting\neffect, because revelation is an experience of pure joy. If you do not\nchoose to be wholly joyous, your mind cannot <em>have</em> what it does not\nchoose to <em>be</em>. Remember that the Soul knows no difference between\n“being” and “having.” The higher mind thinks according to the laws which\nthe Soul obeys and therefore honors only the laws of God. To Him,\ngetting is meaningless and giving is all. Having everything, the Soul\n<em>holds</em> everything <em>by</em> giving it and thus creates as the Father\ncreated.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> If you think about it, you will see that, while this kind of thinking\nis totally alien to having <em>things</em>, even to the lower mind it is quite\ncomprehensible in connection with <em>ideas</em>. If you share a physical\npossession, you <em>do</em> divide its ownership. If you share an idea,\nhowever, you do not lessen it. All of it is still yours, although all of\nit has been given away. Further, if the person to whom you give it\naccepts it as <em>his</em>, he reinforces it in <em>your</em> mind, and thus\n<em>increases</em> it. If you can accept the concept that the world <em>is</em> one of\nideas, the whole belief in the false association which the ego makes\nbetween giving and <em>losing</em> is gone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> Let us start our process of reawakening with just a few simple\nconcepts:</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> <em>Thoughts <strong>increase</strong> by being given away.<br />\nThe more who believe in them, the <strong>stronger</strong> they become.<br />\n<strong>Everything</strong> is an idea.<br />\nHow, then, is it possible that giving and losing <strong>can</strong> be<br />\nmeaningfully associated?</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> This is the invitation to the Holy Spirit. I told you that I could\nreach up and bring the Holy Spirit down to you, but I can bring Him to\nyou <em>only</em> at your own invitation. The Holy Spirit is nothing more than\nyour own right mind. He was also mine.  The Bible says, “May the mind be\nin you that was also in Christ Jesus,” and uses this as a <em>blessing</em>. It\nis the blessing of miracle-mindedness.  It asks that you may think as I\nthought, joining with me in Christ-thinking.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> The Holy Spirit is the only part of the Holy Trinity which is\nsymbolic. He is referred to in the Bible as the Healer, the Comforter,\nand the Guide. He is also described as something “separate,” apart from\nthe Father and from the Son. I myself said, “If I go I will send you\nanother comforter, and He will abide with you.” The Holy Spirit is a\ndifficult concept to grasp precisely because it <em>is</em> symbolic and\ntherefore open to many different interpretations. As a man and as one of\nGod’s creations, my right thinking, which came from the Universal\nInspiration which <em>is</em> the Holy Spirit, taught me first and foremost\nthat this Inspiration is for all. I could not have It myself <em>without</em>\nknowing this.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> The word “know” is proper in this context because the Holy\nInspiration is so close to knowledge that it calls it forth; or better,\nallows it to come. We have spoken before of the higher or the “true”\nperception, which is so close to truth that God Himself can flow across\nthe little gap. Knowledge is always ready to flow everywhere, but it\ncannot oppose. Therefore, you can obstruct it, although you can never\nlose it. The Holy Spirit is the Christ Mind, which senses the knowledge\nthat lies beyond perception. It came into being with the separation as a\nprotection, inspiring the beginning of the Atonement at the same time.\nBefore that, there was no need for healing and no one was comfortless.</p>\n\n",

The Holy Spirit is the Mind of the Atonement. It\nrepresents a state of mind that comes close enough to One-Mindedness\nthat transfer to it is at last possible. Transfer depends on common\nelements in the old learning and the new situation to which it is\ntransferred. Perception is not knowledge, but it can be transferred <em>to</em>\nknowledge or <em>cross over</em> into it. It might even be more helpful here to\nuse the literal meaning of “carried” over since the last step is taken\nby God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> The Holy Spirit, the shared Inspiration of all the Sonship, induces a\nkind of perception in which many elements are like those in the Kingdom\nof Heaven itself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> First, its universality is perfectly clear, and no one who receives\nit could ever believe for one instant that sharing it involves anything\n<em>but</em> gain.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> Second, it is incapable of attack and is therefore truly open. This\nmeans that, although it does not engender knowledge, it does not\n<em>obstruct</em> it in any way. [Third, it is an unequivocal call to love.\nEvery other voice is still.]</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> There is a point at which sufficient quantitative changes produce\nreal qualitative differences. The next point requires real\nunderstanding, because it is the point at which the shift occurs.\nFinally, it points the way <em>beyond</em> the healing which it brings and\nleads the mind beyond its own integration into the paths of creation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> Healing is not creating; it is reparation. The Holy Spirit promotes\nhealing by looking <em>beyond</em> it to what the Children of God were before\nhealing was needed and will be when they have <em>been</em> healed. This\nalteration of the time sequence should be quite familiar, because it is\nvery similar to the shift in time perception which the miracle\nintroduces. The Holy Spirit is the <em>motivation</em> for miracle-mindedness,\nthe will to <em>heal</em> the separation by letting it go. This will is <em>in</em>\nyou, because God placed it in your mind, and although you can keep it\nasleep, you cannot obliterate it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> God Himself keeps this will alive by transmitting it from His Mind to\nyours as long as there is time. It is partly His and partly yours. The\nmiracle itself is just this fusion or union of will between Father and\nSon. The Holy Spirit is the spirit of joy. He is the Call to return with\nwhich God blessed the minds of His separated Sons. This is the vocation\nof the mind. The mind had no calling until the separation, because\nbefore that it had only <em>being</em> and would not have understood the call\nto right thinking. The Holy Spirit was God’s Answer to the separation,\nthe means by which the Atonement could repair until the whole mind\nreturned to creating.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> The Atonement and the separation began at the same time. When man\nmade the ego, God placed in him the call to joy. This call is so strong\nthat the ego always dissolves at its sound. That is why you can choose\nto listen to two voices within you. One you made yourself and that one\nis not of God. But the other is given you <em>by</em> God Who asks you only to\nlisten to it. The Holy Spirit is in you in a very literal sense. His is\nthe Voice that calls you back to where you were before and will be\nagain.</p>\n\n",

It is the final\nlesson that I learned, and God’s Sons are as equal as learners as they\nare as Souls. The Voice of the Holy Spirit <em>is</em> the call to Atonement or\nthe restoration of the integrity of the mind. When the Atonement is\ncomplete and the whole Sonship is healed, there will be no call to\nreturn, but what God creates is eternal. The Holy Spirit will remain\nwith the Sons of God to bless <em>their</em> creations and keep them in the\nlight of joy.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> You <em>are</em> the Kingdom of Heaven, but you have let the belief in\ndarkness enter your minds, and so you need a new light. The Holy Spirit\nis the radiance that you must let banish the idea of darkness. His is\nthe glory before which dissociation falls away and the Kingdom of Heaven\nbreaks through into its own. Before the separation you did not need\nguidance. You <em>knew</em> as you will know again, but as you do <em>not</em> know\nnow. God does not guide because He can share only perfect knowledge.\nGuidance is evaluative, because it implies that there is a <em>right</em> way\nand also a <em>wrong</em> way, one to be chosen and the other to be avoided. By\nchoosing one, you give up the other.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> This <em>is</em> a conflict state. It <em>means</em> that knowledge has been lost,\nbecause knowledge is sure. God is not in you in a literal sense; <em>you</em>\nare part of <em>Him</em>. When you chose to leave Him, He gave you a Voice to\nspeak <em>for</em> Him because He could no longer share His knowledge with you\nwithout hindrance. Direct communication was broken because you had made\nanother voice through another will. The Holy Spirit calls you both to\nremember and to forget. You have chosen to be in a state of opposition\nin which opposites are possible. As a result, there <em>are</em> choices which\nyou must make. In the holy state, the will is free in the sense that its\n<em>creative</em> power is unlimited, but choice itself is meaningless.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> Freedom to choose is the same <em>power</em> as freedom to create, but its\n<em>application</em> is different. Choosing <em>means</em> divided will. The Holy\nSpirit is one way of choosing. This way is in you because there is also\n<em>another</em> way. God did not leave His Children comfortless, even though\nthey chose to leave Him. The voice they put in their minds was <em>not</em> the\nvoice of His Will for which the Holy Spirit speaks. The call to return\nis stronger than the call to depart, but it speaks in a different way.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> The Voice of the Holy Spirit does not command, because it is\nincapable of arrogance. It does not demand, because it does not seek\ncontrol. It does not overcome, because it does not attack. It merely\n<em>reminds</em>. It is compelling only because of what it reminds you <em>of</em>. It\nbrings to your mind the <em>other</em> way, remaining quiet even in the midst\nof the turmoil you have made for yourselves. The Voice for God is always\nquiet, because it speaks of peace. Yet peace is stronger than war\nbecause it heals. War is division, not increase. No one gains from\nstrife.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> “What profiteth it a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own\nSoul?” That means that if he listens to the wrong voice, he has <em>lost\nsight</em> of his Soul. He <em>cannot</em> lose it, but he <em>can</em> not know it. It is\ntherefore <em>lost to him</em> until he chooses right. The Holy Spirit is your\nGuide in choosing. He is the part of your mind which <em>always</em> speaks for\nthe right choice because He speaks for God. He is your remaining\ncommunication with God, which you can interrupt but cannot destroy.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> The Holy Spirit is the way in which God’s Will can be done on earth\nas it is in Heaven. Both Heaven and earth are in <em>you</em>, because the call\nof both is in your will and therefore in your mind. The Voice for God\ncomes from your own altars to Him. These altars are not things; they are\n<em>devotions</em>. Yet you have other devotions now. Your divided devotion has\ngiven you the two voices, and you must choose at which altar you will to\nserve. The call you answer now is an evaluation because it is a\n<em>decision</em>. The decision itself is very simple. It is made on the basis\nof which call is worth more to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> My mind will always be like yours, because we were created as equals.\nIt was only my <em>decision</em> that gave me all power in Heaven and earth. My\nonly gift to you is to help you make the same decision <em>for yourself</em>.\nThe will for this decision is the will to <em>share</em> it, because the\ndecision itself <em>is</em> the decision to share. It is <em>made by giving</em> and\nis therefore the <em>one</em> act of mind that resembles true creation. You\nunderstand the role of “models” in the learning process and the\nimportance of the models you value and choose to follow in determining\nwhat you will to learn. I am your model for decision. By deciding for\nGod, I showed you that this decision <em>can</em> be made and that <em>you</em> can\nmake it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> I promised you that the mind that made the decision for me is also in\n<em>you</em> and that you can let it change you just as it changed me. This\nmind is unequivocal, because it hears only <em>one</em> voice and answers in\nonly <em>one</em> way. You are the light of the world with me. Rest does not\ncome from sleeping but from waking. The Holy Spirit is the call to awake\nand be glad. The world is very tired, because it <em>is</em> the idea of\nweariness. Our task is the joyous one of waking it to the Call for God.\nEveryone will answer the Call of the Holy Spirit, or the Sonship cannot\nbe as one. What better vocation could there be for any part of the\nKingdom than to restore it to the perfect integration that can make it\nwhole?</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> Hear only this through the Holy Spirit within you, and teach your\nbrothers to listen as I am teaching you. When you are tempted by the\nwrong voice, call on me to remind you how to heal by sharing my decision\n<em>and making it stronger</em>. As we share this goal we increase its power to\nattract the whole Sonship and to bring it back into the Oneness in which\nit was created. Remember that “yoke” means “join together” and “burden”\nmeans “message.” Let us reconsider the Biblical statement, “My yoke is\neasy and my burden light” in this way: “Let us join together, for my\nmessage is light.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> I came into your minds because you had grown vaguely aware of the\nfact that there <em>is</em> another way or another Voice. Having given this\ninvitation to the Holy Spirit, I could come to provide the model for\n<em>how to think</em>. Psychology has become the study of <em>behavior</em>, but no\none denies the basic law that behavior is a response to <em>motivation</em>,\nand motivation is will. I have enjoined you to behave as I behaved, but\nwe must respond to the same mind to do this. This mind is the Holy\nSpirit, whose will is for God always. He teaches you how to keep me as\nthe model for your thought and to behave like me as a result.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> The power of our joint motivation is beyond belief but <em>not</em> beyond\naccomplishment. What we can accomplish together <em>has</em> no limits, because\nthe Call for God <em>is</em> the call to the unlimited. Child of God, my\nmessage is for <em>you</em> to hear and give away as you answer the Holy Spirit\nwithin you.</p>\n\n",

The\nrelationship <em>must</em> be in His Mind because, unless it were, the\nseparation between the two ways of thinking would not be open to\nhealing. He is part of the Holy Trinity because His Mind is partly yours\nand also partly God’s. This needs clarification, not in statement, since\nwe have said it before, but in <em>experience</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> The Holy Spirit is the <em>idea</em> of healing. Being thought, the idea\n<em>gains as it is shared</em>. Being the Call <em>for</em> God, it is also the idea\n<em>of</em> God. Since <em>you</em> are part of God, it is also the idea of <em>yourself</em>\nas well as of all the parts of God. The idea of the Holy Spirit shares\nthe property of other ideas, because it follows the laws of the Universe\nof which it is a part. Therefore, it is strengthened by being given\naway. It increases in <em>you</em> as you give it to your brothers. Since\nthoughts do not have to be conscious to exist, your brother does not\nhave to be aware of the Holy Spirit either in himself or in you for this\nmiracle to occur.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> Your brother may have dissociated the Call for God, just as <em>you</em>\nhave. The dissociation is healed in <em>both</em> of you as <em>you</em> become aware\nof the Call for God in him and thus acknowledge its <em>being</em>. There are\ntwo ways of seeing your brother which are diametrically opposed to each\nother. They must both be in <em>your</em> mind, because <em>you</em> are the\nperceiver. They must also be in <em>his</em>, because you are perceiving <em>him</em>.\nSee him through the Holy Spirit in <em>his</em> mind, and you will recognize\nHim in <em>yours</em>. What you acknowledge in your brother you <em>are</em>\nacknowledging in yourself, and what you share you strengthen.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> The Voice of the Holy Spirit <em>is</em> weak in you. That is why you <em>must</em>\nshare it. It must be <em>increased</em> in strength before <em>you</em> can hear it.\nIt is impossible to hear it in yourself while it is so weak in your\n<em>own</em> mind. It is not weak in itself, but it <em>is</em> limited by your\nunwillingness to hear it. Will itself is an idea and is therefore\nstrengthened by being shared. If you make the mistake of looking for the\nHoly Spirit in yourself alone, your meditations will frighten you\nbecause by <em>adopting</em> the ego’s viewpoint you are undertaking an\nego-alien journey with the ego as <em>guide</em>. This is <em>bound</em> to produce\nfear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> Delay is of the ego, because time is <em>its</em> concept. Delay is\nobviously a time idea. Both time and delay are meaningless in eternity.\nWe have said before that the Holy Spirit is God’s <em>Answer</em> to the ego.\nEverything of which the Holy Spirit reminds you is in direct opposition\nto the ego’s notions, because true and false perceptions are\n<em>themselves</em> opposed. The Holy Spirit has the task of <em>undoing</em> what the\nego has made. He undoes it in the same realm of discourse in which the\nego itself operates, or the mind would be unable to understand the\nchange.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> We have repeatedly emphasized that one level of the mind is not\nunderstandable to another. So it is with the ego and the Soul, with time\nand eternity. Eternity is an idea of God, so the Soul understands it\nperfectly. Time is a belief of the ego, so the lower mind, which <em>is</em>\nthe ego’s domain, accepts it without question. The only aspect of time\nwhich is really eternal is <em>now</em>. That is what we really mean when we\nsay that “now is the only time.” The literal nature of this statement\ndoes not mean anything to the ego, which interprets it at best to mean\n“don’t worry about the future.” That is not what it really means at all.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> The Holy Spirit is the Mediator between the interpretations of the\nego and the knowledge of the Soul. His ability to deal with symbols\nenables Him to work <em>against</em> the ego’s beliefs in its own language. His\nequal ability to look <em>beyond</em> symbols into eternity also enables Him to\nunderstand the laws of God, for which He speaks. He can thus perform the\nfunction of <em>reinterpreting</em> what the ego makes, <em>not</em> by destruction\nbut by <em>understanding</em>. Understanding is light, and light leads to\nknowledge. The Holy Spirit is <em>in</em> light because He is in you who <em>are</em>\nlight, but you yourselves do not know this. It is therefore the task of\nthe Holy Spirit to reinterpret <em>you</em> on behalf of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> You cannot understand yourselves alone. This is because you have no\nmeaning <em>apart</em> from your rightful place in the Sonship and the rightful\nplace of the Sonship [is] God. This is your life, your eternity, and\n<em>yourself</em>. It is of this that the Holy Spirit reminds you. It is this\nthat the Holy Spirit <em>sees</em>. This vision invariably frightens the ego\nbecause it is so calm. Peace is the ego’s greatest enemy because,\naccording to <em>its</em> interpretation of reality, war is the guarantee of\nits survival. The ego becomes strong in strife. If you believe there\n<em>is</em> strife, you will react viciously because the idea of danger has\nentered your mind. The idea itself <em>is</em> an appeal to the ego.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> The Holy Spirit is as vigilant as the ego to the call of danger,\nopposing it with His strength, just as the ego <em>welcomes</em> it with all\nits might. The Holy Spirit counters this welcome by welcoming peace.\nPeace and eternity are as closely related as are time and war.\nPerception as well as knowledge derives meaning from relationships.\nThose which you accept are the foundations of your beliefs. The\nseparation is merely another term for a split mind. It was not an act,\nbut a <em>thought</em>. Therefore, the idea of separation can be given away,\njust as the idea of unity can. Either way, the idea will be strengthened\n<em>in the mind of the giver</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> The ego is the symbol of separation, just as the Holy Spirit is the\nsymbol of peace. What you perceive in others, you are strengthening in\n<em>yourself</em>. You let your mind misperceive, but the Holy Spirit lets your\nmind reinterpret its own misperceptions. The Holy Spirit is the perfect\nteacher. He uses only what your minds <em>already</em> understand to teach you\nthat you do <em>not</em> understand it. The Holy Spirit can deal with an\nunwilling learner without going counter to his will because part of his\nwill <em>is</em> still for God. Despite the ego’s attempts to conceal this\npart, it is still much stronger than the ego, even though the ego does\nnot recognize it. The Holy Spirit recognizes it perfectly, because it is\nHis own dwelling place or the place in the mind where He is at home.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> <em>You</em> are at home there, too, because it is a place of peace, and\npeace is of God. You who are part of God are not at home <em>except</em> in His\npeace. If peace is eternal, you are at home only in eternity. The ego\nmade the world as <em>it</em> perceives it, but the Holy Spirit, the\n<em>reinterpreter</em> of what the ego made, sees it only as a teaching device\nfor bringing you home. The Holy Spirit must perceive time and\nreinterpret it into the timeless. The mind must be led into eternity\n<em>through</em> time because, having made time, it is capable of perceiving\nits opposite.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> The Holy Spirit must work through opposites, because He must work\nwith and for a mind that <em>is</em> in opposition. Correct and learn and be\nopen to learning. You have <em>not</em> made truth, but truth can still set you\nfree. Look as the Holy Spirit looks, and understand as He understands.\nHis understanding looks back to God in remembrance of me. He is in Holy\nCommunion always, and He is part of <em>you</em>. He is your Guide to\nsalvation, because He holds the remembrance of things past and to come.\nHe holds this gladness gently in your minds, asking only that you\n<em>increase</em> it in His name by sharing it, to increase His joy in <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>44</sup> You must have noticed how often I have used your own ideas to help\nyou. You have learned to be a loving, wise, and very understanding\ntherapist <em>except for yourself</em>. That exception has given you more than\nperception for others because of what you saw in <em>them</em> but <em>less</em> than\nknowledge of your real relationships <em>to</em> them, because you did not\naccept them as <em>part</em> of you. Understanding <em>is</em> beyond perception\nbecause it introduces meaning. It is, however, below knowledge even\nthough it can grow <em>towards</em> it. It is possible, with great effort, to\nunderstand someone else to some extent and to be quite helpful to him,\nbut the effort is misdirected. The misdirection is quite apparent; it is\ndirected away from <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> This does not mean that it is <em>lost</em> to you, but it <em>does</em> mean that\nyou are not aware of it. I have saved all your kindnesses and every\nloving thought you have had. I have purified them of the errors which\nhid their light and have kept them for you in their own perfect\nradiance. They are beyond destruction and beyond guilt. They came from\nthe Holy Spirit within <em>you</em>, and we know what God creates is eternal.\nWhat fear has hidden still is part of you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> Joining the Atonement, which I have repeatedly asked you to do, is\nalways a way <em>out</em> of fear. This does not mean that you can safely fail\nto acknowledge anything that is true. However, the Holy Spirit will not\nfail to help you reinterpret everything that you perceive as fearful and\nteach you that <em>only</em> what is loving <em>is</em> true. Truth is beyond your\nability to destroy but entirely within your grasp. It belongs to you\nbecause you created it. It is yours because it is a part of you, just as\nyou are part of God because He created <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> The Atonement is the <em>guarantee</em> of the safety of the Kingdom.\nNothing good is lost because it comes from the Holy Spirit, the Voice\nfor creation. Nothing that is <em>not</em> good was ever created and therefore\n<em>cannot</em> be protected. What the ego makes, it <em>keeps to itself</em>, and so\nit is without strength. Its unshared existence does not die; it was\nmerely never born. Real birth is not a beginning; it is a <em>continuing</em>.\nEverything that can continue has <em>been</em> born, but it can <em>increase</em> as\nyou are willing to return the part of your mind that needs healing to\nthe higher part and thus render your creating undivided.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> As a therapist, you yourself tell your patients that the real\ndifference between neurotic and “healthy” guilt feelings is that\nneurotic guilt feelings <em>do not help anyone</em>. This distinction is wise\nthough incomplete. Let us make the distinction a little sharper now.\nNeurotic guilt feelings are a device of the ego for “atoning” without\nsharing and for asking pardon without change. The ego <em>never</em> calls for\n<em>real</em> Atonement and cannot tolerate forgiveness, which <em>is</em> change.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> Your concept of “healthy guilt feelings” has merit, but without the\nconcept of the Atonement, it lacks the healing potential it holds. You\nmade the distinction in terms of feelings, which led to a decision not\nto <em>repeat</em> the error, which is only <em>part</em> of healing. Your concept\nlacked the idea of <em>undoing</em> it. What you were really advocating, then,\nwas adopting a policy of sharing without a real <em>foundation</em>. I have\ncome to <em>give</em> you the foundation, so your own thoughts can make you\n<em>really</em> free. You have carried the burden of the ideas you did not\nshare and which were therefore too weak to increase, but you did not\nrecognize how to undo their existence <em>because</em> you had made them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> You <em>cannot</em> cancel out your past errors alone. They will <em>not</em>\ndisappear from your mind without remedy. The remedy is <em>not</em> of your\nmaking, any more than <em>you</em> are. The Atonement cannot be understood\nexcept as a <em>pure act of sharing</em>. That is what is meant when we said it\nis possible even in this world to listen to <em>one</em> voice. If you are part\nof God and the Sonship is one, you <em>cannot</em> be limited to the “self” the\nego sees. Every loving thought held in <em>any</em> part of the Sonship belongs\nto every part. It is shared <em>because</em> it is loving. Sharing is God’s way\nof creating and also <em>yours</em>. Your ego can keep you in exile <em>from</em> the\nKingdom, but in the Kingdom itself it has no power.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> You have become willing to receive my messages as I give them without\ninterference by the ego, so we can clarify an earlier point. We said\nthat you will one day teach as much as you learn and that will keep you\nin balance. The time is now because you have <em>let</em> it be now. You cannot\nlearn <em>except</em> by teaching.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> I heard one voice because I had learned that learning is attained\n<em>by</em> teaching. I understood that <em>I could not atone for myself alone</em>.\nListening to one voice means the will to <em>share</em> the voice in order to\nhear it yourself. The mind that was in me is still irresistibly drawn to\nevery mind created by God, because God’s Wholeness <em>is</em> the wholeness of\nHis Son.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> Turning the other cheek does <em>not</em> mean that you should submit to\nviolence without protest. It means that you cannot <em>be</em> hurt and do not\nwant to show your brother anything <em>except</em> your wholeness. Show him\nthat he <em>cannot</em> hurt you and hold nothing against him, or you hold it\nagainst yourself. Teaching is done in many ways: by formal means, by\nguidance, and above all <em>by example</em>. Teaching is therapy, because it\nmeans the <em>sharing</em> of ideas and the awareness that to share them is to\n<em>strengthen</em> them. The union of the Sonship <em>is</em> its protection. The ego\ncannot prevail against the Kingdom <em>because</em> it is united, and the ego\nfades away and is undone in the presence of the attraction of the parts\nof the Sonship, which hear the call of the Holy Spirit to be as One.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> I cannot forget my need to teach what I have learned, which arose in\nme <em>because</em> I learned it. I call upon you to teach what you have\nlearned, because by so doing <em>you</em> can depend on it. Make it dependable\nin my name, because my name is the name of God’s Son. What I learned I\ngive you freely, and the mind which was in me rejoices as <em>you</em> choose\nto hear it. The Holy Spirit atones in all of us by <em>undoing</em> and thus\nlifts the burden you have placed in your mind. By following Him, He\nleads you back to God where you belong, and how can you find this way\nexcept by taking your brother with you?</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> My part in the Atonement is not complete until <em>you</em> join it and give\nit away. As you teach, so shall you learn. I will never leave you or\nforsake you, because to forsake you would be to forsake myself and God\nwho created me. You will forsake yourselves and God if you forsake <em>any</em>\nof your brothers. You are more than your brother’s keeper. In fact, you\ndo not <em>want</em> to keep him. You must learn to see him as he is and <em>know</em>\nthat he belongs to God as you do. How could you treat your brother\nbetter than by rendering unto God the things which are God’s?</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Ideas do not <em>leave</em> the mind which thought them to have a separate\nbeing, nor do separate thoughts conflict with one another in space,\nbecause they do not occupy space at all. However, human ideas <em>can</em>\nconflict in content, because they occur at different levels and include\nopposite thoughts at the <em>same</em> level. <em>It is impossible to share\nopposing thoughts</em>. The Holy Spirit does not <em>let</em> you forsake your\nbrothers. Therefore, you can really share <em>only</em> the parts of your\nthoughts which are of Him and which He also keeps for <em>you</em>. And of such\nis the Kingdom of Heaven. All the rest remains with you until He has\nreinterpreted them in the light of the Kingdom, making them, too, worthy\nof being shared. When they have been sufficiently purified, He lets you\ngive them away. The will to share them <em>is</em> their purification.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> The Atonement gives you the power of a healed mind, but the power to\ncreate is of God. Therefore, those who have been forgiven must devote\nthemselves first to healing, because having <em>received</em> the idea of\nhealing, they must <em>give</em> it to <em>hold</em> it. The full power of creation\ncannot be expressed as long as <em>any</em> of God’s ideas withhold it from the\nKingdom. The joint will of <em>all</em> the Sonship is the only creator that\ncan create like the Father, because only the complete can think\ncompletely, and the thinking of God lacks nothing. Everything you think\nthat is not through the Holy Spirit <em>is</em> lacking.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> How can you who are so holy suffer? All your past except its beauty\nis gone, and nothing is left except a blessing. You can indeed depart in\npeace, because I have loved you as I loved myself. You go <em>with</em> my\nblessing and <em>for</em> my blessing. Hold it and share it, that it may always\nbe ours. I place the peace of God in your heart and in your hands, to\nhold and share. The heart is pure to hold it and the hands are strong to\ngive it. We cannot lose. My judgment is as strong as the wisdom of God,\nin Whose heart and hands we have our being. His quiet Children are His\nblessed Sons. The thoughts of God are with you.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>59</sup> Perhaps some of our concepts will become clearer and more personally\nmeaningful if the ego’s use of guilt is clarified. The ego has a\npurpose, just as the Holy Spirit has. The ego’s purpose is <em>fear</em>\nbecause <em>only</em> the fearful can <em>be</em> egotistic. The ego’s logic is as\nimpeccable as that of the Holy Spirit, because your mind has all the\nmeans at its disposal to side with Heaven or earth, as it elects. But\nagain, let us remember that both are in <em>you</em>. In Heaven there is no\nguilt, because the Kingdom is attained through the Atonement, which\nreleases you to create. The word “create” is appropriate here because,\nonce what <em>you</em> have made is undone by the Holy Spirit, the blessed\nresidue is restored and therefore continues in creation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> What is truly blessed is incapable of giving rise to guilt and <em>must</em>\ngive rise to joy. This makes it invulnerable to the ego because its\npeace is unassailable. It is invulnerable to disruption <em>because</em> it is\nwhole. Guilt is <em>always</em> disruptive. Anything that engenders fear is\ndivisive because it obeys the law of division. If the ego is the symbol\nof the separation, it is also the symbol of guilt. Guilt is more than\nmerely not of God. It is the symbol of the <em>attack</em> on God. This is a\ntotally meaningless concept <em>except</em> to the ego, but do not\nunderestimate the power of the ego’s belief in it. This is the belief\nfrom which <em>all</em> guilt really stems.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> The ego <em>is</em> the part of the mind which believes in division. How can\npart of God detach itself <em>without</em> believing it is attacking Him? We\nspoke before of the authority problem as involving the concept of\n<em>usurping</em> God’s power. The ego believes that this is what <em>you</em> did\nbecause it believes it <em>is</em> you. It follows, then, that if you identify\n<em>with</em> the ego, you <em>must</em> perceive yourself as guilty. Whenever you\nrespond to your ego, you <em>will</em> experience guilt and you <em>will</em> fear\npunishment. The ego is quite literally a fearful thought.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> However ridiculous the idea of attacking God may be to the <em>sane</em>\nmind, never forget that the ego is <em>not</em> sane. It represents a\ndelusional system, and it speaks <em>for</em> it. Listening to the ego’s voice\n<em>means</em> that you believe it is possible to attack God. You believe that\na part of Him has been torn away by <em>you</em>. The classic picture of fear\nof retaliation <em>from without</em> then follows because the severity of the\nguilt is so acute that it <em>must</em> be projected. Although Freud was wrong\nabout the basic conflict itself, he was very accurate in describing its\neffects.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> Whatever you accept <em>into</em> your mind has reality for you. It is,\nhowever, only your <em>acceptance</em> of it that makes it real. If you\nenthrone the ego in it, the fact that you have accepted it or allowed it\nto enter <em>makes</em> it your reality. This is because the mind, as God\ncreated it, <em>is</em> capable of creating reality. We said before that you\nmust learn to think <em>with</em> God. To think with Him is to think <em>like</em>\nHim. This engenders joy, not guilt, because it is natural. Guilt is a\nsure sign that your thinking is <em>un</em>natural. Perverted thinking will\n<em>always</em> be attended with guilt because it <em>is</em> the belief in sin.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> The ego does not perceive sin as a lack of love. It perceives sin as\na <em>positive act of assault</em>. This is an interpretation which is\nnecessary to the ego’s survival, because as soon as you regard sin as a\n<em>lack</em> you will automatically attempt to remedy the situation. And you\nwill succeed. The ego regards this as doom, but <em>you</em> must learn to\nregard it as freedom. The guiltless mind <em>cannot</em> suffer. Being sane, it\nheals the body because <em>it</em> has been healed. The sane mind cannot\nconceive of illness, because it cannot conceive of attacking anyone or\nanything.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> We said before that illness is a form of magic. It might be better to\nsay that it is a form of magical solution. The ego believes that by\npunishing <em>itself</em> it will mitigate the punishment of God. Yet even in\nthis it is arrogant. It attributes to God a punishing intent, and then\ntakes over this intent as its <em>own</em> prerogative. It tries to usurp <em>all</em>\nthe functions of God as it perceives them, because it recognizes that\nonly total allegiance can be trusted.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> The ego cannot <em>oppose</em> the laws of God any more than <em>you</em> can, but\nit can <em>interpret</em> them according to what it wants, just as <em>you</em> can.\nThat is why the question, “What <em>do</em> you want?” must be answered. You\n<em>are</em> answering it every minute and every second, and each moment of\ndecision is a judgment which is anything <em>but</em> ineffectual. Its effects\nwill follow automatically <em>until the decision is changed</em>. This is\nrepeated here because you have not learned it. But again, your decision\ncan be <em>unmade</em> as well as made. Remember, though, that the\n<em>alternatives</em> are unalterable.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> The Holy Spirit, like the ego, is a decision. Together they\nconstitute all the alternatives which the mind can accept and obey. The\nego and the Holy Spirit are the <em>only</em> choices open to you. God created\none, and so you <em>cannot</em> eradicate it. <em>You</em> made the other, and so you\n<em>can</em>. <em>Only</em> what God creates is irreversible and unchangeable. What\n<em>you</em> have made can always be changed, because when you do not think\n<em>like</em> God you are not really thinking at all. Delusional ideas are not\nreal thoughts, although you <em>can</em> believe in them. But you are wrong.\nThe function of thought comes <em>from</em> God and is <em>in</em> God. As part of His\nThought, you cannot think <em>apart</em> from Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> Irrational thought is a thought <em>disorder</em>. God Himself orders your\nthought because your thought was created <em>by</em> Him. Guilt feelings are\nalways a sign that you do not know this. They also show that you believe\nyou can think apart from God <em>and want to</em>. Every thought disorder is\nattended by guilt at its inception and maintained by guilt in its\ncontinuance. Guilt is inescapable for those who believe they order their\nown thought and must therefore obey its orders. This makes them feel\n<em>responsible</em> for their mind errors, without recognizing that by\n<em>accepting</em> this responsibility they are really reacting irresponsibly.\nIf the <em>sole</em> responsibility of the miracle worker is to accept the\nAtonement for himself, and I assure you that it is, then the\nresponsibility for what is atoned <em>for</em> cannot <em>be</em> yours.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> The dilemma cannot be resolved except by accepting the solution of\n<em>undoing</em>. You <em>would</em> be responsible for the effects of all your wrong\nthinking if it could not be undone. The purpose of the Atonement is to\nsave the past in purified form only. If you accept the remedy for a\nthought disorder, and a remedy whose efficacy is beyond doubt, how can\nits symptoms remain? You have reason to question the validity of symptom\ncure, but <em>no one</em> believes that the symptoms can remain if the\nunderlying <em>cause</em> is removed.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>70</sup> The <em>continuing</em> will to remain separated is the only possible reason\nfor continuing guilt feelings. We have said this before, but we did not\nemphasize the destructive results of this decision at that time. <em>Any</em>\ndecision of the mind will affect both behavior <em>and</em> experience. What\nyou will, you <em>expect</em>. This is not delusional. Your mind <em>does</em> create\nyour future, and it can turn it back to full creation at any minute <em>if\nit accepts the Atonement first</em>. It will also turn back to full creation\nthe instant it has done so. Having given up its thought disorder, the\nproper ordering of thought becomes quite apparent.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> God in His knowledge is not waiting, but His Kingdom is bereft while\n<em>you</em> wait. All the Sons of God are waiting for your return, just as\n<em>you</em> are waiting for <em>theirs</em>. Delay does not matter in eternity, but\nit <em>is</em> tragic in time. You have elected to be in time rather than\neternity and have therefore changed your belief in your status. Yet your\nelection is both free and alterable. You do not belong in time. Your\nplace is <em>only</em> in eternity, where God Himself placed you forever.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> Guilt feelings are the <em>preservers</em> of time. They induce fears of\nfuture retaliation or abandonment and thus ensure that the future will\nremain like the past. This is the ego’s continuity and gives it a false\nsense of security through the belief that you cannot escape from it. But\nyou can and <em>must</em>. God offers you the continuity of eternity in\nexchange. When you choose to make this exchange, you will simultaneously\nexchange guilt for joy, viciousness for love, and pain for peace. My\nrole is only to unchain your will and make it free. Your ego cannot\naccept this freedom and will oppose your free decision at every possible\nmoment and in every possible way. And as its maker, you recognize what\nit can do because you <em>gave</em> it the power to do it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> The mind does indeed know its power, because the mind does indeed\nknow God. Remember the Kingdom always, and remember that you who are\npart of the Kingdom <em>cannot</em> be lost. The mind that was in me <em>is</em> in\nyou, for God creates with perfect fairness. Let the Holy Spirit remind\nyou always of His fairness, and let me teach you how to share it with\nyour brothers. How else can the chance to claim it for yourself be given\nyou? What you do not understand is that the two voices speak for\ndifferent interpretations of the same thing simultaneously, or almost\nsimultaneously, for the ego always speaks first. Alternate\ninterpretations were unnecessary until the first one was made, and\nspeaking itself was unnecessary before the ego was made.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> The ego speaks in judgment and the Holy Spirit reverses its\ndecisions, much as the Supreme Court has the power to reverse the lower\ncourts’ decisions about the laws of this world. The ego’s decisions are\n<em>always</em> wrong, because they are based on a complete fallacy which they\nwere made to uphold. <em>Nothing</em> the ego perceives is interpreted\ncorrectly. Not only does it cite Scripture for its purpose, but it even\ninterprets Scripture as a witness for itself. The Bible is a fearful\nthing to the ego because of its prejudiced judgment. Perceiving it as\nfearful, it interprets it fearfully. Having made <em>you</em> afraid, you do\nnot appeal to the Higher Court, because you believe its judgment would\nbe <em>against</em> you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> We need cite only a few examples to see how the ego’s interpretations\nhave misled you. A favorite ego quotation is “As ye sow, so shall ye\nreap.” Another is “Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord.” Still another is\n“I will visit the sins of the father unto the third and fourth\ngeneration,” and also “The wicked shall perish.” There are many others,\nbut if you will let the Holy Spirit reinterpret these in His own light,\nthey will suffice.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> “As ye sow, so shall ye reap” merely means that what you believe to\nbe worth cultivating you will cultivate in yourself. Your judgment of\nwhat is worthy <em>makes</em> it worthy for you. “Vengeance is mine, sayeth the\nLord” is easily explained if you remember that ideas increase only by\nbeing shared. This quotation therefore emphasizes the fact that\nvengeance <em>cannot</em> be shared. Give it therefore to the Holy Spirit, who\nwill undo it in you because it does not belong in your mind, which is\npart of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> “I will visit the sins of the fathers unto the third and fourth\ngeneration,” as interpreted by the ego, is particularly vicious. It is\nused, in fact, as an attempt to guarantee its survival beyond itself.\nActually, all the quotation means is that the Holy Spirit in later\ngenerations retains the power to interpret <em>correctly</em> what former\ngenerations have thought and thus release <em>their</em> thoughts from the\nability to produce fear anywhere in the Sonship. “The wicked shall\nperish” is merely a statement of fact if the word “perish” is properly\nunderstood. Every loveless thought <em>must</em> be undone. Even the word\n“undone” is fearful to the ego, which interprets “I am undone” as “I am\ndestroyed.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> The ego will <em>not</em> be destroyed because it is part of your thought,\nbut because it is uncreative and therefore unsharing, it <em>will</em> be\nreinterpreted entirely to release you from fear. The part of your\nthought which you have given to the ego will merely return to the\nKingdom, where your whole mind <em>belongs</em>. The ego is a form of arrest,\nbut arrest is merely delay. It does <em>not</em> involve the concept of\npunishment, although the ego welcomes that interpretation. You <em>can</em>\ndelay the completion of the Kingdom, but you <em>cannot</em> introduce the\nconcept of assault into it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> When I said, “I am come as a light into the world,” I surely came to\nshare the light with you. Remember the symbolic reference we made before\nto the ego’s dark glass, and remember also that we said, “Do not look\nthere.” It is still true that “where you look to find yourself is up to\nyou.” The Higher Court will <em>not</em> condemn you. It will merely dismiss\nthe case against you. There can <em>be</em> no case against a Child of God, and\nevery witness to guilt in God’s creations is bearing false witness to\nGod Himself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> Appeal everything you believe gladly to God’s own Higher Court,\nbecause it speaks for Him and therefore speaks truly. It will dismiss\nthe case against you, however carefully <em>you</em> have built it. The case\nmay be foolproof, but it is <em>not</em> God-proof. The Voice for God will not\nhear it at all because He can only witness truly. His verdict will\nalways be “Thine is the Kingdom” because He was <em>given</em> you to remind\nyou of what you are.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> Your patience with each other is your patience with yourselves. Is\nnot a Child of God <em>worth</em> patience? I have shown you infinite patience\nbecause my will <em>is</em> that of our Father, from Whom I learned of infinite\npatience. His Voice was in me as it is in you, speaking for patience\ntowards the Sonship in the name of its Creator. What you need to learn\nnow is that only infinite patience <em>can</em> produce immediate effects. This\nis the way in which time is exchanged for eternity. Infinite patience\ncalls upon infinite love, and by producing results <em>now</em>, it renders\ntime unnecessary.</p>\n\n<p><sup>82</sup> To say that time is temporary is merely redundant. We have repeatedly\nsaid that time is a learning device which will be abolished when it is\nno longer useful. The Holy Spirit, Who speaks for God in time, also\nknows that time is meaningless. He reminds you of this in every passing\nmoment of time, because it is His special function to return you to\neternity and remain to bless <em>your</em> creations there. He is the only\nblessing you can truly give, because He is so truly blessed, and because\nHe has been given you so freely by God, you must give Him as you\nreceived Him.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>83</sup> The idea of “set” is among the better psychological concepts.\nActually, it is used quite frequently in the Bible and also in this\ncourse under many different terms. For example, “God will keep him in\nperfect peace whose mind is stayed (or set) on Him,” a statement which\nmeans that God’s peace is set in the Holy Spirit because it is fixed on\nGod. It is also fixed in you. You, then, <em>are</em> fixed in the peace of\nGod. The concept of “fixation” is also a very helpful one which Freud\nunderstood perfectly. Unfortunately, he lost his understanding because\nhe was afraid and, as you know all too well, fear is incompatible with\ngood judgment. Fear distorts thinking and therefore <em>dis</em>orders thought.</p>\n\n<p><sup>84</sup> Freud’s system of thought was extremely ingenious because Freud was\nextremely ingenious, and a mind <em>must</em> endow its thoughts with its own\nattributes. This is its inherent strength, although it may misuse its\npower. Freud lost much of the potential value of his thought system,\nbecause he did <em>not</em> include himself in it. This is a dissociated state,\nbecause the thinker cuts himself off from his thoughts. Freud’s thought\nwas so conflicted that he could not have retained his sanity as <em>he</em> saw\nit <em>without</em> dissociation. That is why the many contradictions which are\nquite apparent in his thinking became increasingly less apparent to\n<em>him</em>. A man who knows what fixation really means and yet does not yield\nto it is terribly afraid.</p>\n\n<p><sup>85</sup> Fixation is the pull of God, on whom your mind <em>is</em> fixed because of\nthe Holy Spirit’s irrevocable set. “Irrevocable” means “cannot be called\nback or redirected.” The irrevocable nature of the Holy Spirit’s set is\nthe basis for His unequivocal Voice. The Holy Spirit <em>never</em> changes His\nMind. Clarity of thought <em>cannot</em> occur under conditions of vacillation.\nUnless a mind is fixed in its purpose, it is <em>not</em> clear. Clarity\nliterally means the state of light, and enlightenment <em>is</em>\nunderstanding. Enlightenment stands <em>under</em> perception, because you have\ndenied it as the <em>real</em> foundation of thought. This is the basis for\n<em>all</em> delusional systems.</p>\n\n<p><sup>86</sup> The concept of fixation as Freud saw it has a number of learning\nadvantages. First, it recognizes that man can be fixated at a point in\ndevelopment which does <em>not</em> accord with a point in time. This clearly\ncould have been a means toward real release from the time belief, had\nFreud pursued it with an open mind. Freud, however, suffered all his\nlife from refusal to allow eternity to dawn upon his mind and enlighten\nit truly. As a result, he overlooked <em>now</em> entirely and merely saw the\ncontinuity of past and future.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> Second, although Freud misinterpreted what the Holy Spirit told him,\nor better, reminded him of, he was too honest to deny more than was\nnecessary to keep his fear in tolerable bounds as he perceived the\nsituation. Therefore, he emphasized that the point in development at\nwhich the mind is fixated is more real to <em>itself</em> than the external\nreality with which it disagrees. This again could have been a powerful\n<em>release</em> mechanism had Freud not decided to involve it in a strong\n<em>defense</em> system because he perceived it as an attack.</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> Third, although Freud interpreted fixation as involving irrevocable\n“danger points” to which the mind could always regress, the concept can\nalso be interpreted as an irrevocable call to sanity which the mind\ncannot <em>lose</em>. Freud himself could not accept this interpretation, but\nthroughout his thought system, the “threat” of fixation remained and\ncould never be eliminated by any living human being. Essentially, this\nwas the basis of Freud’s pessimism, personally as well as theoretically.\nHe tried every means his very inventive mind could devise to set up a\nform of therapy which could enable the mind to escape from fixation\nforever, even though he <em>knew</em> this was impossible.</p>\n\n<p><sup>89</sup> This knowledge plagued Freud’s belief in his own thought system at\nevery turn because he was both an honest man and a healer. He was\ntherefore only partially insane and was unable to relinquish the <em>hope</em>\nof release even though he could not cope with it. The reason for this\namount of detail is because <em>you</em> are in the same position. You were\neternally fixated on God in your creation, and the pull of this fixation\nis so strong that you will never overcome it. The reason is perfectly\nclear. The fixation is on a level so high that it cannot <em>be</em>\nsurmounted. You are <em>always</em> being pulled back to your Creator, because\nyou <em>belong</em> to Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>90</sup> Do you <em>really</em> believe you can make a voice that can drown out His?\nDo you <em>really</em> believe that you can devise a thought system which can\nseparate you from His? Do you <em>really</em> believe that you can plan for\nyour safety and joy better than He can? You need be neither careful nor\ncareless; you need merely cast your cares upon Him, because He careth\nfor <em>you</em>. You <em>are</em> His care because He loves you. His Voice reminds\nyou always that all hope is yours <em>because</em> of His care. You <em>cannot</em>\nchoose to escape His care because that is not His Will, but you <em>can</em>\nchoose to accept His care and use the infinite power <em>of</em> His care for\nall those He created <em>by</em> it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>91</sup> There have been many healers who did not heal themselves. They have\nnot moved mountains by their faith, because their faith was not whole.\nSome of them have healed the sick at times, but they have not raised the\ndead. Unless the healer heals <em>himself</em>, he does <em>not</em> believe that\nthere is no order of difficulty in miracles. He has not learned that\n<em>every</em> mind God created is equally worthy of being healed <em>because God\ncreated it whole</em>. You are merely asked to return to God the mind as\n<em>He</em> created it. He asks you only for what He gave, knowing that this\ngiving will heal you. Sanity <em>is</em> wholeness, and the sanity of your\nbrothers <em>is</em> yours.</p>\n\n<p><sup>92</sup> Why should you listen to the endless insane calls which you think are\nmade upon you when you <em>know</em> the Voice of God Himself is in you? God\ncommended His Spirit to you and asks that you commend yours to Him. He\nwills to keep it in perfect peace, because you are of one mind and\nspirit with Him. Excluding yourself from the Atonement is the ego’s\nlast-ditch defense of its <em>own</em> existence. It reflects both the ego’s\nneed to separate and your willingness to side with its separateness.\nThis willingness means <em>that you do not want to be healed</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>93</sup> But the time <em>is</em> now. You have not been asked to work out the plan\nof salvation yourselves because, as I told you before, the remedy is\n<em>not</em> of your making. God Himself gave you the perfect correction for\neverything you have made which is <em>not</em> in accord with His holy Will. I\nhave made His plan perfectly explicit to you and have also told you of\nyour part in His plan and how urgent it is that you fulfill it. There is\ntime for delay, but there need not be. God weeps at the “sacrifice” of\nHis Children, who believe they are lost to Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>94</sup> I have already told you that whenever you are not wholly joyous it is\nbecause you have reacted with a lack of love to some Soul which God\ncreated. Perceiving this as “sin,” you become defensive because you\n<em>expect attack</em>. The decision to react in this way, however, is <em>yours</em>\nand can therefore be undone. It <em>cannot</em> be undone by repentance in the\nusual sense because this implies guilt. If you allow yourself to feel\nguilty, you will <em>reinforce</em> the error rather than allow it to be undone\n<em>for</em> you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>95</sup> Decisions <em>cannot</em> be difficult. This is obvious if you realize that\nyou must <em>already</em> have made a decision <em>not</em> to be wholly joyous if\nthat is how you feel. Therefore, the first step in the undoing is to\nrecognize that you <em>actively decided wrongly</em> but can <em>as actively\ndecide otherwise</em>. Be very firm with yourselves in this, and keep\nyourselves fully aware of the fact that the undoing process, which does\n<em>not</em> come from you, is nevertheless <em>within</em> you because God placed it\nthere. <em>Your</em> part is merely to return your thinking to the point at\nwhich the error was made and give it over to the Atonement in peace. Say\nto yourselves the following as sincerely as you can, remembering that\nthe Holy Spirit will respond fully to your slightest invitation:</p>\n\n<p><sup>96</sup> <em>I must have decided wrongly, because I am <strong>not</strong> at peace.<br />\nI made the decision myself, but I can also decide otherwise.<br />\nI <strong>will</strong> to decide otherwise, because I <strong>want</strong> to be at peace.<br />\nI do <strong>not</strong> feel guilty, because the Holy Spirit will undo<br />\nall the consequences of my wrong decision <strong>if I will let Him.</strong><br />\nI <strong>will</strong> to let Him, by allowing Him to decide for God for Me.</em></p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>4</sup> For teaching purposes, let us consider the crucifixion again. We have\nnot dwelt on it before because of its fearful connotations. The only\nemphasis we laid upon it was that it was <em>not</em> a form of punishment.\nNothing, however, can be really explained in negative terms only. There\nis a positive interpretation of the crucifixion which is wholly devoid\nof fear and therefore wholly benign in what it teaches if it is properly\nunderstood. The crucifixion is nothing more than an extreme example. Its\nvalue, like the value of any teaching device, lies solely in the kind of\nlearning it facilitates. It can be and has been misunderstood. This is\nonly because the fearful are apt to perceive fearfully.</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> I have already told you that you can always call on me to share my\ndecision and thus <em>make it stronger</em>. I also told you that the\ncrucifixion was the last foolish journey that the Sonship need take and\nthat it should mean <em>release</em> from fear to anyone who understands it.\nWhile we emphasized only the resurrection before, the purpose of the\ncrucifixion and how it actually <em>led</em> to the resurrection was not\nclarified at that time. Nevertheless, it has a definite contribution to\nmake to your own lives, and if you will consider it <em>without</em> fear, it\nwill help you understand your own role as teachers.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> You have reacted for years <em>as if</em> you were being crucified. This is a\nmarked tendency of the separated ones, who always refuse to consider\nwhat they have done <em>to themselves</em>. Projection means anger, anger\nfosters assault, and assault promotes fear. The real meaning of the\ncrucifixion lies in the <em>apparent</em> intensity of the assault of some of\nthe Sons of God upon another. This, of course, is impossible and must be\nfully understood <em>as</em> an impossibility. In fact unless it <em>is</em> fully\nunderstood as only that, I cannot serve as a real model for learning.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> Assault can ultimately be made <em>only</em> on the body. There is little\ndoubt that one <em>body</em> can assault another and can even destroy it. Yet\nif destruction <em>itself</em> is impossible, then anything that is\ndestructible cannot be <em>real</em>. Therefore, its destruction does <em>not</em>\njustify anger. To the extent to which you believe that it <em>does</em>, you\nmust be accepting false premises <em>and teaching them to others</em>. The\nmessage which the crucifixion was intended to teach was that it is not\nnecessary to perceive <em>any</em> form of assault in persecution, because you\ncannot <em>be</em> persecuted. If you respond with anger, you must be equating\nyourself with the destructible and are therefore regarding yourself\ninsanely.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> I have made it perfectly clear that I am like you and you are like me,\nbut our fundamental equality can be demonstrated only through joint\n<em>decision</em>. You are free to perceive yourselves as persecuted if you\nchoose. You might remember, however, when you <em>do</em> choose to react that\nway, that I <em>was</em> persecuted as the world judges and did <em>not</em> share\nthis evaluation for myself. And because I did not share it, I did not\n<em>strengthen</em> it. I therefore offered a <em>different</em> interpretation of\nattack and one which I <em>do</em> want to share with you. If you will\n<em>believe</em> it, you will help me to <em>teach</em> it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> We have said before, “As you teach, so shall you learn.” If you react\nas if you are persecuted, you are <em>teaching</em> persecution. This is not a\nlesson which the Sons of God should <em>want</em> to teach if they are to\nrealize their own salvation. Rather, teach your own perfect immunity,\nwhich <em>is</em> the truth in you, and <em>know</em> that it cannot be assailed. Do\nnot protect it yourselves, or you have believed that it <em>is</em> assailable.\nYou are not asked to <em>be</em> crucified, which was part of my own teaching\ncontribution. You are merely asked to follow my example in the face of\nmuch <em>less</em> extreme temptations to misperceive and <em>not</em> to accept them\nfalsely as justifications for anger.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> There can <em>be</em> no justification for the unjustifiable. Do not believe\nthere is, and do not <em>teach</em> that there is. Remember always that what\nyou believe you <em>will</em> teach. Believe with me, and we will become equal\nas teachers. <em>Your</em> resurrection is your reawakening. I am the model for\nrebirth, but rebirth itself is merely the dawning on your minds of what\nis already in them. God placed it there Himself, and so it is true\nforever. I believed in it and therefore made it forever true for me.\nHelp me to teach it to our brothers in the name of the Kingdom of God,\nbut first believe that it is true for <em>you</em>, or you will teach amiss.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> My brothers slept during the so-called “agony in the garden,” but I\ncould not be angry with them because I had learned I could not <em>be</em>\nabandoned. Peter swore he would never deny me, but he did so three\ntimes. He did offer to defend me with the sword, which I naturally\nrefused, not being at all in need of bodily protection. I <em>am</em> sorry\nwhen my brothers do not share my decision to hear only one voice,\nbecause it weakens them as teachers <em>and</em> as learners. Yet I know that\nthey cannot really betray themselves <em>or</em> me and that it is still on\nthem that I must build my church.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> There is no choice in this because only you can <em>be</em> the foundation\nof God’s church. A church is where an altar is, and the presence of the\naltar is what <em>makes</em> it a church. Any church which does not inspire\nlove has a hidden altar which is not serving the purpose for which God\nintended it. I must found His church on you because you who accept me as\na model are literally my disciples. Disciples are followers, but if the\nmodel they follow has chosen to save them pain in all respects, they are\nprobably unwise <em>not</em> to follow him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> I elected both for your sake <em>and</em> mine to demonstrate that the most\noutrageous assault as judged by the ego did not matter. As the world\njudges these things, but <em>not</em> as God <em>knows</em> them, I was betrayed,\nabandoned, beaten, torn, and finally killed. It was perfectly clear that\nthis was only because of the projection of others, because I had not\nharmed anyone and had healed many. We are still equal as learners, even\nthough we need not have equal experiences. The Holy Spirit is glad when\nyou can learn enough from mine to be re-awakened by them. That was their\nonly purpose, and that is the only way in which I can be perceived as\nthe Way, the Truth, and the Light.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> When you hear only one voice, you are <em>never</em> called on to sacrifice.\nOn the contrary, by enabling yourselves to hear the Holy Spirit in\nothers, you can learn from their experiences and gain from them\n<em>without</em> experiencing them yourselves. That is because the Holy Spirit\nis one, and anyone who listens is inevitably led to demonstrate His way\nfor all. You are not persecuted, nor was I. You are not asked to\n<em>repeat</em> my experiences, because the Holy Spirit, Whom we <em>share</em>, makes\nthis unnecessary. To <em>use</em> my experiences constructively, however, you\nmust still follow my example in how to perceive them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> My brothers and yours are constantly engaged in justifying the\nunjustifiable. My one lesson, which I must teach as I learned, is that\nno perception which is out of accord with the judgment of the Holy\nSpirit <em>can</em> be justified. I undertook to show this was true in a very\nextreme case merely because it would serve as a good teaching aid to\nthose whose temptations to give in to anger and assault would <em>not</em> be\nso extreme. I will with God that none of His Sons should suffer.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> Remember that the Holy Spirit is the communication link between God\nthe Father and His separated Sons. If you will listen to His Voice, you\nwill know that you cannot either hurt or <em>be</em> hurt and that many need\nyour blessing to help them hear this for themselves. When you perceive\n<em>only</em> this need in them and do not respond to <em>any</em> other, you will\nhave learned of me and will be as eager to share your learning as I am.\nThe crucifixion <em>cannot</em> be shared, because it is the symbol of\nprojection, but the resurrection is the symbol of <em>sharing</em>, because the\nreawakening of every Son of God is necessary to enable the Sonship to\nknow its wholeness. Only this <em>is</em> knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> The message of the crucifixion is [very simple and] perfectly\nclear:</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> <em>Teach</em> <strong><em>only</em></strong> <em>love, for that is what you</em> <strong><em>are.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> If you interpret the crucifixion in any other way, you are using it\nas a weapon for assault rather than as the call for peace for which it\nwas intended.  The Apostles often misunderstood it and always for the\nsame reason that makes anyone misunderstand anything. Their own\nimperfect love made them vulnerable to projection, and out of their own\nfear they spoke of the “wrath of God” as His retaliatory weapon. Nor\ncould they speak of the crucifixion entirely without anger, because\ntheir own sense of guilt had <em>made</em> them angry.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> There are two glaring examples of upside-down thinking in the New\nTestament, whose whole gospel is <em>only</em> the message of love. These are\nnot like the several slips into impatience which I made. I had learned\nthe Atonement prayer, which I also came to teach, too well to engage in\nupside-down thinking myself. If the Apostles had not felt guilty, they\nnever could have quoted me as saying, “I come not to bring peace but a\nsword.” This is clearly the exact opposite of everything I taught.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> Nor could they have described my reactions to Judas as they did if\nthey had really understood me. They would have realized I <em>could</em> not\nhave said, “Betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss?” unless I\n<em>believed</em> in betrayal. The whole message of the crucifixion was simply\nthat I did <em>not</em>. The “punishment” which I am said to have called forth\nupon Judas was a similar reversal. Judas was my brother and a Son of\nGod, as much a part of the Sonship as myself. Was it likely that I would\ncondemn him when I was ready to demonstrate that condemnation is\nimpossible?</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> I am very grateful to the Apostles for their teaching and fully aware\nof the extent of their devotion to me. Nevertheless, as you read their\nteachings, remember that I told them myself that there was much they\nwould understand later because they were <em>not</em> wholly ready to follow me\nat the time. I emphasize this only because I do not want you to allow\n<em>any</em> fear to enter into the thought system toward which I am guiding\nyou. I do <em>not</em> call for martyrs but for <em>teachers</em>. No one is\n“punished” for sins, and the Sons of God are not sinners.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> <em>Any</em> concept of “punishment” involves the projection of blame and\n<em>reinforces</em> the idea that blame is justified. The behavior that results\nis a <em>lesson in blame</em>, just as all behavior teaches the beliefs which\nmotivate it. The crucifixion was a complex of behaviors arising out of\nclearly opposed thought systems. As such, it [is] the perfect symbol\nof conflict between the ego and the Son of God. [It was as much\nintrapersonal as interpersonal then, just as it is now, and it is still\njust as real. But because it is just as real now, its lesson, too, has\nequal reality <em>when it is learned</em>.] I do not need gratitude any more\nthan I needed protection, but you need to develop your weakened ability\nto <em>be</em> grateful, or you cannot appreciate God. He does not need your\nappreciation, but <em>you</em> do.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> You cannot love what you do not appreciate, and <em>fear makes\nappreciation impossible</em>. Whenever you are afraid of what you are, you\ndo <em>not</em> appreciate it and will therefore reject it. As a result, you\nwill <em>teach rejection</em>. The power of the Sons of God is operating all\nthe time because they were created as creators. Their influence on <em>each\nother</em> is without limit and <em>must</em> be used for their joint salvation.\nEach one must learn to teach that all forms of rejection are utterly\nmeaningless. The separation <em>is</em> the notion of rejection. As long as you\n<em>teach</em> this, you still believe it. This is <em>not</em> as God thinks, and you\nmust think as He thinks if you are to know Him again.</p>\n\n",

Since you have also\njudged <em>against</em> what you project, you continue to attack it because you\nhave already attacked it <em>by</em> projecting it. By doing this\nunconsciously, you try to keep the fact that you must have attacked\nyourself <em>first</em> out of awareness and thus imagine that you have made\nyourself safe.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> Projection will <em>always</em> hurt you. It reinforces your belief in your\nown split mind, and its <em>only</em> purpose is <em>to keep the separation\ngoing</em>. It is <em>solely</em> a device of the ego to make you feel <em>different</em>\nfrom your brothers and separated from them. The ego justifies this on\nthe wholly spurious grounds that it makes you seem “better” than they\nare, thus obscuring your equality with them still further. Projection\nand attack are inevitably related, because projection is <em>always</em> a\nmeans of justifying attack. Anger without projection is impossible.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> The ego uses projection <em>only</em> to distort your perception both of\nyourself <em>and</em> your brothers. The process begins by excluding something\n[you think] exists in you which you do not want and leads directly to\nexcluding you from your brothers. We have learned, however, that there\nis another use of projection. Every ability of the ego has a better\ncounterpart, because its abilities are directed by the mind which has a\nbetter Voice. The Holy Spirit as well as the ego utilizes projection,\nbut since their goals are opposed, so is the result.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> The Holy Spirit begins by perceiving <em>you</em> as perfect. <em>Knowing</em> this\nperfection is shared, He recognizes it in others, thus strengthening it\nin both. Instead of anger, this arouses love for both <em>because it\nestablishes inclusion</em>. Perceiving equality, the Holy Spirit perceives\nequal needs. This invites Atonement automatically, because Atonement is\nthe one need which in this world <em>is</em> universal. To perceive yourself\nthis way is the <em>only</em> way in which you can find happiness in the world.\nThat is because it is the acknowledgment that you are <em>not</em> in this\nworld, for the world <em>is</em> unhappy.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> How else can you find joy in a joyless place <em>except</em> by realizing\nthat you are <em>not</em> there? You cannot be anywhere that God did not put\nyou, and God created you as part of Him. That is both <em>where</em> you are\nand <em>what</em> you are. It is <em>completely</em> unalterable. It is total\ninclusion. You cannot change it now or ever. It is forever true. It is\nnot a belief but a <em>fact</em>. Anything that God create[s] is as true as\nHe is. Its truth lies only in its perfect inclusion in Him, Who alone\n<em>is</em> perfect. To deny this in any way is to deny yourself <em>and</em> Him\nsince it is impossible to accept one <em>without</em> the other.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> The perfect equality of the Holy Spirit’s perception is the\ncounterpart of the perfect equality of God’s knowing. The ego’s\nperception <em>has</em> no counterpart in God, but the Holy Spirit remains the\nbridge between perception and knowledge. By enabling you to use\nperception in a way that <em>parallels</em> knowledge, you will ultimately meet\nit and <em>know</em> it. The ego would prefer to believe that this meeting is\nimpossible, yet it is <em>your</em> perception which the Holy Spirit guides.\nYou might remember that the human eye perceives parallel lines <em>as</em> <em>if</em>\nthey meet in the distance, which is the same as in the future if time\nand space are one dimension. Your perception <em>will</em> end where it began.\n<em>Everything</em> meets in God, because everything was created <em>by</em> Him and\n<em>in</em> Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> God created His Sons by extending His Thought and retaining the\nextensions of His Thought in His Mind. <em>All</em> His Thoughts are thus\nperfectly united within themselves and with each other, because they\nwere created neither partially nor in part. The Holy Spirit enables you\n<em>to perceive this wholeness now</em>. You can no more pray for yourselves\nalone than you can find joy for yourself alone. Prayer is the\nrestatement of <em>inclusion</em>, directed by the Holy Spirit under the laws\nof God. God created you to create. You cannot <em>extend</em> His Kingdom until\nyou know of its wholeness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> Thoughts begin in the mind of the thinker from which they [extend]\noutward. This is as true of God’s thinking as it is of yours. Because\nyour minds are split, you can also perceive as well as think. Yet\nperception cannot escape from the basic laws of mind. You perceive\n<em>from</em> your mind and extend your perceptions outward. Although\nperception of any kind is unnecessary, <em>you</em> made it, and the Holy\nSpirit can therefore use it well. He can <em>inspire</em> perception and lead\nit toward God by making it <em>parallel</em> to God’s way of thinking and thus\nguarantee their ultimate meeting. This convergence <em>seems</em> to be far in\nthe future only because your mind is not in perfect alignment with the\nidea and therefore <em>does not want it now</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> The Holy Spirit <em>uses</em> time but does <em>not</em> believe in it. Coming from\nGod, He uses everything for good, but He does not <em>believe</em> in what is\nnot true. Since the Holy Spirit is <em>in</em> your minds, your minds must also\nbe able to believe only what is true. The Holy Spirit can speak only for\nthis because he speaks for God. He tells you to return your whole mind\nto God, because it has <em>never left Him</em>. If it has never left Him, you\nneed only perceive it as it is to <em>be</em> returned. The full awareness of\nthe Atonement, then, is the recognition <em>that the separation never\noccurred.</em> The ego cannot prevail against this because it is an explicit\nstatement that the <em>ego</em> never occurred.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> The ego <em>can</em> accept the idea that return is necessary because it can\nso easily make the idea seem so difficult. Yet the Holy Spirit tells you\nthat even return is unnecessary because what never happened cannot\ninvolve <em>any</em> problem. It does <em>not</em> follow, however, that <em>you</em> cannot\nmake the idea of return [both] necessary <em>and</em> difficult. It is surely\nclear, however, that the perfect <em>need</em> nothing and <em>cannot</em> experience\nperfection as a difficult accomplishment, because that is what they\n<em>are.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> This is the way in which you <em>must</em> perceive God’s creations,\nbringing all of your perceptions into the one parallel line which the\nHoly Spirit sees. This line is the direct line of communication with God\nand lets your mind converge with <em>His</em>. There is no conflict anywhere in\nthis perception, because it means that <em>all</em> perception is guided by the\nHoly Spirit, Whose Mind is fixed on God. <em>Only</em> the Holy Spirit can\nresolve conflict, because <em>only</em> the Holy Spirit is conflict-free. He\nperceives <em>only</em> what is true in your mind and extends outward <em>only</em> to\nwhat is true in other minds.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> The difference between the ego’s use of projection and projection as\nthe Holy Spirit uses it is very simple. The ego projects to <em>exclude</em>\nand therefore to deceive. The Holy Spirit projects by <em>recognizing\nHimself</em> in every mind and thus perceives them as <em>one</em>. Nothing\nconflicts in this perception, because what the Holy Spirit perceives\n<em>is</em> the same. Wherever He looks He sees Himself, and because He is\nunited, He offers the whole Kingdom always. This is the one message God\ngave <em>to</em> Him and for which He must speak, because that is what He <em>is</em>.\nThe peace of God lies in that message, and so the peace of God lies in\n<em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> The great peace of the Kingdom shines in your mind forever, but it\nmust shine <em>outward</em> to make <em>you</em> aware of it. The Holy Spirit was\ngiven you with perfect impartiality, and only by perceiving Him\nimpartially can you perceive Him at all. The ego is legion, but the Holy\nSpirit is One. No darkness abides anywhere in the Kingdom, but your part\nis only to allow no darkness to abide in your <em>own</em> mind. This alignment\nwith light is unlimited, because it is in alignment with the light of\nthe world. Each of us <em>is</em> the light of the world, and by joining our\nminds <em>in</em> this light, we proclaim the Kingdom of God together and <em>as\none</em>.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>39</sup> We have used many words as synonymous which are not ordinarily\nregarded as the same. We began with having and being and more recently\nhave used others. Hearing and being are examples, to which we can also\nadd teaching and being, learning and being and, above all, <em>projecting</em>\nand being. This is because, as we have said before, every idea begins in\nthe mind of the thinker and extends outward. Therefore, what extends\n<em>from</em> the mind <em>is still in it</em>, and from what it extends it knows\n<em>itself</em>. That is its natural talent. The word “knows” is correct here,\neven though the ego does <em>not</em> know and is not concerned with being at\nall.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> The Holy Spirit still holds knowledge safe through His impartial\nperception. By attacking nothing, He presents no barrier at all to the\ncommunication of God. Thus, being is never threatened. Your Godlike mind\ncan never <em>be</em> defiled. The ego never was and never will be part of it,\nbut <em>through</em> the ego you can hear and teach and learn <em>what is not\ntrue</em>. From this, which <em>you</em> have made, you have taught yourselves to\nbelieve that you <em>are not</em> what you <em>are.</em> You <em>cannot</em> teach what you\nhave not learned, and what you teach you strengthen in yourselves\n<em>because</em> you are sharing it. Every lesson you teach <em>you</em> are learning.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> That is why you must teach only <em>one</em> lesson. If you are to be\nconflict-free yourselves, you must learn <em>only</em> from the Holy Spirit and\nteach <em>only</em> by Him. You <em>are</em> only love, but when you denied this, you\nmade what you <em>are</em> something you must <em>learn</em>. We said before that the\nmessage of the crucifixion was, “Teach only love, for that is what you\n<em>are</em>.” This is the <em>one</em> lesson which is perfectly unified, because it\nis the only lesson which <em>is</em> one. Only <em>by</em> teaching it can you learn\nit. “As you teach, so will you learn.” If that is true, and it is true\nindeed, you must never forget that what you teach is teaching <em>you</em>.\nWhat you project you <em>believe</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> The only <em>real</em> safety lies in projecting only the Holy Spirit\nbecause, as you see His gentleness in others, your <em>own</em> mind perceives\n<em>itself</em> as totally harmless. Once it can accept this fully, it does\n<em>not</em> see the need to <em>protect itself.</em> The protection of God then dawns\nupon it, assuring it that it is perfectly safe forever. The perfectly\nsafe are wholly benign. They bless because they know they <em>are</em> blessed.\nWithout anxiety the mind is wholly kind, and because it <em>projects</em>\nbeneficence, it <em>is</em> beneficent.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> Safety is <em>the complete relinquishment of attack</em>. No compromise is\npossible in this. Teach attack in <em>any</em> form, and <em>you have learned it,\nand it will hurt you.</em> Yet your learning is not immortal, and you can\nunlearn it by <em>not teaching it</em>. Since you cannot <em>not</em> teach, your\nsalvation lies in teaching the exact <em>opposite</em> of everything the ego\nbelieves. This is how <em>you</em> will learn the truth that will set you free\nand keep you so, as others learn it of <em>you.</em> The only way to <em>have</em>\npeace is to <em>teach</em> peace. By learning it through projection, it becomes\na part of what you <em>know</em>, because you cannot teach what you have\ndissociated.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> Only thus can you win back the knowledge that you threw away. An idea\nwhich you <em>share</em>, you must <em>have</em>. It awakens in you through the\nconviction of teaching. Remember that, if teaching is being and learning\nis being, [then] teaching is learning. <em>Everything</em> you teach, you are\nlearning. Teach only love, and learn that love is yours and <em>you</em> are\nlove.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>45</sup> Remember that the Holy Spirit is the <em>Answer, not</em> the question. The\nego always speaks first because it is capricious and does <em>not</em> mean its\nmaker well. That is because it believes, and correctly, that its maker\nmay withdraw his support from it at any moment. If it meant you well, it\nwould be glad, as the Holy Spirit will be glad when He has brought you\nhome and you no longer need His guidance. The ego does not regard itself\nas <em>part</em> of you. Herein lies its primary perceptual error, the\nfoundation of its whole thought system.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> When God created you, He made you part of Him. That is why attack\n<em>within</em> the Kingdom is impossible. <em>You</em> made the ego without love, and\nso it does not love <em>you</em>. You could not remain <em>within</em> the Kingdom\nwithout love, and since the Kingdom is love, you believe that you are\n<em>without</em> it. This enables the ego to regard itself as separate and\n<em>outside</em> its maker, thus speaking for the part of your mind that\nbelieves you are separate and outside the Mind of God. The ego, then,\nraised the first question that was ever asked, but one which it can\nnever answer. That question, “What are you?” was the beginning of doubt.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> The ego has never answered <em>any</em> questions since, although it has\nraised a great many. The most inventive activities of the ego have never\ndone more than <em>obscure the question</em>, because you <em>have</em> the answer and\n<em>the ego is afraid of you</em>. You cannot understand the conflict until you\nfully understand one basic fact that the ego does <em>not</em> know. The Holy\nSpirit does not speak first, <em>but He always answers</em>. Everyone has\ncalled upon Him for help at one time or another and in one way or\nanother <em>and has been answered</em>. Since the Holy Spirit answers truly, He\nanswers <em>for all time</em>, which means that everyone has the answer <em>now</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> The ego cannot hear the Holy Spirit, but it <em>does</em> believe that part\nof the same mind that made it is <em>against</em> it. It interprets this as a\njustification for <em>attacking</em> its maker. It believes that the best\ndefense <em>is</em> attack and <em>wants you to believe it</em>. Unless you <em>do</em>\nbelieve it you will not side with it, and the ego feels badly in need of\nallies though <em>not</em> of brothers. Perceiving something alien to itself in\nyour mind, the ego turns to the body, <em>not</em> the mind, as its ally,\nbecause the body is <em>not</em> part of you. This makes the body the ego’s\nfriend. It is an alliance frankly based on separation. If you <em>side</em>\nwith this alliance, you <em>will</em> be afraid, because you are siding with an\nalliance of fear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> The ego and the body conspire <em>against</em> your minds, and because the\nego realizes that its “enemy” <em>can</em> end them both merely by knowing they\nare <em>not</em> part of him, they join in the attack together. This is perhaps\nthe strangest perception of all if you consider what it really involves.\nThe ego, which is <em>not</em> real, attempts to persuade the mind, which <em>is</em>\nreal, that the mind is its own learning device and that the learning\ndevice is more real than <em>it</em> is. No one in his right mind could\n<em>possibly</em> believe this, and no one in his right mind <em>does</em> believe it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> Hear then the <em>one</em> answer of the Holy Spirit to <em>all</em> the questions\nwhich the ego raises. You are a Child of God, a priceless part of His\nKingdom, which He created as part of Him. Nothing else exists, and\n<em>only</em> this is real. You have chosen a sleep in which you have had bad\ndreams, but the sleep is not real, and God calls you to awake. There\nwill be nothing left of your dream when you hear Him, because you <em>will</em>\nbe awake. Your dreams have contained many of the ego’s symbols, and they\nhave confused you. Yet that was only because you were asleep <em>and did\nnot know</em>. When you awake, you will see the truth around you and in you,\nand you will no longer believe in dreams because they will have no\nreality for you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> Yet the Kingdom and all that you have created there will have great\nreality for you, because they are beautiful and true. In the Kingdom,\nwhere you are and what you are is perfectly certain. There is no doubt\nthere because the first question was never asked. Having finally been\nwholly answered, <em>it has never been</em>. Being alone lives in the Kingdom,\nwhere everything lives in God without question. The time that was spent\non questioning in the dream has given way to creation and to its\neternity.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> <em>You</em> are as certain as God because you are as true as He is, but\nwhat was once quite certain in your minds has become only the <em>ability</em>\nfor certainty. The introduction of abilities into being was the\nbeginning of <em>un</em>certainty because abilities are potentials, <em>not</em>\naccomplishments. Your abilities are totally useless in the presence of\nGod’s accomplishments and also of yours. Accomplishments are results\nwhich <em>have been</em> achieved. When they are perfect, abilities are\nmeaningless. It is curious that the perfect must now be perfected. In\nfact, it is impossible. You must remember, however, that when you put\nyourselves in an impossible situation, you believed that the impossible\n<em>was</em> possible.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> Abilities must be <em>developed</em>, or you cannot use them. This is not\ntrue of anything that God created, but it is the kindest solution\npossible to what <em>you</em> have made. In an impossible situation, you can\ndevelop your abilities to the point where they can <em>get you out of it</em>.\nYou have a Guide to how to develop them, but you have no <em>commander</em>\nexcept yourself. This leaves <em>you</em> in charge of the Kingdom with both a\nGuide to <em>find</em> it and a means to <em>keep</em> it. You have a model to follow\nwho will <em>strengthen</em> your command and never detract from it in any way.\nYou therefore retain the central place in your perceived enslavement, a\nfact which <em>itself</em> demonstrates that you are <em>not</em> enslaved.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> You are in an impossible situation only because you thought it was\npossible to be in one. You <em>would</em> be in an impossible situation if God\nshowed you your perfection and <em>proved</em> to you that you were wrong. This\nwould demonstrate that the perfect were inadequate to bring <em>themselves</em>\nto the awareness of their perfection and thus side with the belief that\nthose who have everything need help and are therefore helpless. This is\nthe kind of “reasoning” which the ego engages in, but God, Who <em>knows</em>\nthat His creations are perfect, does <em>not</em> insult them. This would be as\nimpossible as the ego’s notion that <em>it</em> has insulted <em>Him.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> That is why the Holy Spirit <em>never</em> commands. To command is to assume\n<em>in</em>equality, which the Holy Spirit demonstrates does not exist.\nFidelity to premises is a law of mind, and everything God created is\nfaithful to His laws. Fidelity to other laws is also possible, however,\nnot because the laws are true, but because <em>you made them</em>. What would\nbe gained if God proved to you that you have thought insanely? Can God\nlose His own certainty? We have frequently stated that what you teach\nyou <em>are.</em> Would you have God teach you that you have sinned? If He\nconfronted the self you made with the truth He created for you, what\ncould you be but afraid? You would doubt your sanity, which is the one\nthing in which you can <em>find</em> the sanity He gave you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> God does not teach. To teach is to imply a lack, which God <em>knows</em> is\nnot there. God is not conflicted. Teaching aims at change, but God\ncreated only the changeless. The separation was not a loss of perfection\nbut a failure in communication. A harsh and strident form of\ncommunication arose as the ego’s voice. It could not shatter the peace\nof God, but it <em>could</em> shatter <em>yours.</em> God did not blot it out, because\nto eradicate it would be to attack it. Being questioned, He did not\nquestion. He merely gave the Answer. His Answer is your Teacher.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"a-to-have-give-all-to-all\">a. To Have, Give All to All</h2>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> Like any good teacher, the Holy Spirit does know more than you do\n<em>now</em>, but He teaches only to make you <em>equal</em> with Him. This is because\nyou had already taught wrongly, having believed what was not true. <em>You\ndid not believe in your own perfection.</em> Could God teach you that you\nhad made a split mind, when He knows your mind only as whole? What God\n<em>does</em> know is that His communication channels are not open to Him so\nthat He cannot impart His joy and know that His Children are wholly\njoyous. This is an ongoing process, not in time, but in eternity. God’s\nextending outward, though not His completeness, is blocked when the\nSonship does not communicate with Him as one. So He thought, “My\nChildren sleep and must be awakened.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> How can you wake children better and more kindly than by a gentle\nVoice that will not frighten them but will merely remind them that the\nnight is over and the light has come? You do not inform them that the\nnightmares which frightened them so badly were not real because children\n<em>believe</em> in magic. You merely reassure them that they are safe <em>now</em>.\nThen you train them to <em>recognize the difference</em> between sleeping and\nwaking, so that they will understand they need not be afraid of dreams.\nThen when bad dreams come, they will call on the light <em>themselves</em> to\ndispel them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> A wise teacher teaches through approach, <em>not</em> avoidance. He does\n<em>not</em> emphasize what you must avoid to escape from harm so much as what\nyou need to learn to have joy. This is true even of the world’s\nteachers. Consider the confusion a child would experience if he were\ntold, “Do not do <em>this</em> because it might hurt you and make you unsafe,\nbut if you do <em>that</em> you will escape from harm and be safe, and then you\nwill not be afraid.” All of this could be included in only three words:\n“Do <em>only</em> that!” This simple statement is perfectly clear, easily\nunderstood, and very easily remembered.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> The Holy Spirit <em>never</em> itemizes errors because He does not frighten\nchildren, and those who lack wisdom <em>are</em> children. Yet He <em>always</em>\nanswers their call, and His dependability makes <em>them</em> more certain.\nChildren <em>do</em> confuse fantasy and reality, and they <em>are</em> frightened,\nbecause they do not know the difference. The Holy Spirit makes <em>no</em>\ndistinction among dreams. He merely shines them away. His light is\n<em>always</em> the call to awake, whatever you have been dreaming. Nothing\nlasting lies in dreams, and the Holy Spirit, shining with the light from\nGod Himself, speaks only for what lasts forever.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> When your body and your ego and your dreams are gone, you will know\nthat <em>you</em> will last forever. Many think this is accomplished through\ndeath, but <em>nothing</em> is accomplished through death because death <em>is</em>\nnothing. <em>Everything</em> is accomplished through life, and life is of the\nmind and <em>in</em> the mind. The body neither lives nor dies, because it\ncannot contain you who <em>are</em> life. If we share the same mind, you can\novercome death <em>because I did</em>. Death is an attempt to resolve conflict\nby not willing at all. Like any other impossible solution which the ego\nattempts, <em>it will not work</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> God did not make the body because it is destructible and therefore\nnot of the Kingdom. The body is the symbol of what you <em>think</em> you are.\nIt is clearly a separation device and therefore does not exist. The Holy\nSpirit, as always, takes what you have made and translates it into a\nlearning device <em>for</em> you. Again as always, He re-interprets what the\nego uses as an argument <em>for</em> separation into a demonstration <em>against</em>\nit. If the mind can heal the body but the body cannot heal the mind,\nthen the mind must be <em>stronger</em>. Every miracle demonstrates this.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> We have said that the Holy Spirit is the <em>motivation</em> for miracles.\nThis is because He always tells you that <em>only</em> the mind is real since\n<em>only</em> the mind <em>can be shared</em>. The body <em>is</em> separate and therefore\n<em>cannot</em> be part of you. To be of one mind <em>is</em> meaningful, but to be of\none <em>body</em> is meaningless. By the laws of mind, then, the <em>body</em> is\nmeaningless. To the Holy Spirit, <em>there is no order of difficulty in\nmiracles.</em> This is <em>familiar</em> enough to you by now, but it has not yet\nbecome believable. Therefore, you do not understand it and cannot <em>use</em>\nit.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> We have too much to accomplish on behalf of the Kingdom to let this\ncrucial concept slip away. It is a real foundation stone of the thought\nsystem I teach and want <em>you</em> to teach. You cannot perform miracles\nwithout believing it, because it is a belief in perfect equality. Only\none equal gift <em>can</em> be offered to the equal Sons of God, and that is\n<em>full appreciation</em>. Nothing more and nothing less. Without a range, an\norder of difficulty <em>is</em> meaningless, and there must <em>be</em> no range in\nwhat you offer to each other.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> The Holy Spirit, who leads to God, translates communication into\nbeing, just as He ultimately translates perception into knowledge. [You\n<em>do not lose what you communicate.</em>] The ego uses the body for attack,\nfor pleasure, and for pride. The insanity of this perception makes it a\nfearful one indeed. The Holy Spirit sees the body <em>only</em> as a means of\n<em>communication</em> and because communicating is sharing, it becomes\ncommunion. You might argue that fear as well as love can be communicated\nand therefore can be shared. Yet this is not so real as it sounds. Those\nwho communicate fear are promoting attack, and attack always <em>breaks</em>\ncommunication, making it impossible.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> Egos <em>do</em> join together in temporary allegiance but always for <em>what\neach one can get separately.</em> The Holy Spirit communicates only <em>what\neach one can give to all</em>. He never takes anything back, because He\nwants <em>you</em> to keep it. Therefore, His teaching begins with the lesson:</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> <em>To <strong>have</strong>, <strong>give</strong> all <strong>to</strong> all</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> This is a very preliminary step, and the only one you must take for\nyourself. It is not even necessary that you <em>complete</em> the step\nyourself, but it <em>is</em> necessary that you turn in that direction. Having\nchosen to go that way, you place <em>yourself</em> in charge of the journey,\nwhere you and <em>only</em> you must remain.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> This step <em>appears</em> to exacerbate conflict rather than resolve it,\nbecause it is the <em>beginning</em> step in reversing your perception and\nturning it right-side up. This conflicts with the upside-down perception\nwhich you have not yet abandoned, or the change in direction would not\nhave been necessary. Some people remain at this step for a very long\ntime, experiencing <em>very</em> acute conflict. At this point, many try to\naccept the <em>conflict</em> rather than take the next step towards its\nresolution. Having taken the first step, however, they <em>will</em> be helped.\nOnce they have chosen what they <em>cannot</em> complete alone, <em>they are no\nlonger alone.</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"b-to-have-peace-teach-peace-to-learn-it\">b. To Have Peace, Teach Peace to Learn It</h2>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> All the separated ones have a basic fear of retaliation and\nabandonment. This is because they <em>believe</em> in attack and rejection, so\nthis is what they perceive and teach and <em>learn</em>. These insane concepts\nare clearly the result of their own dissociation and projection. What\nyou teach you are, but it is quite apparent that you can teach wrongly\nand therefore <em>teach yourselves wrong</em>. Many thought that <em>I</em> was\nattacking them, even though it was quite apparent that I was not. An\ninsane learner learns strange lessons.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> What you must understand is that when you do not <em>share</em> a thought\nsystem, you <em>are</em> weakening it. Those who <em>believe</em> in it therefore\nperceive this as an attack <em>on them</em>. This is because everyone\nidentifies <em>himself</em> with his thought system, and <em>every</em> thought system\ncenters on <em>what you believe you are</em>. If the center of the thought\nsystem is true, only truth extends from it. But if a lie is at its\ncenter, only <em>deception</em> proceeds from it. All good teachers realize\nthat only fundamental change will last, but they do not <em>begin</em> at that\nlevel. Strengthening <em>motivation</em> for change is their first and foremost\ngoal. It is also their last and final one.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> Increasing motivation for change <em>in the learner</em> is all that a\nteacher <em>need</em> do to guarantee change. This is because a change in\nmotivation <em>is</em> a change of mind, and this will inevitably produce\nfundamental change, because the mind <em>is</em> fundamental. The first step in\nthe reversal or undoing process, then, is the undoing of the <em>getting</em>\nconcept. Accordingly, the Holy Spirit’s first lesson was “to <em>have</em>,\n<em>give</em> all <em>to</em> all.” We said that this is apt to increase conflict\ntemporarily, and we can clarify this still further now.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> At this point, the equality of “having” and “being” is not yet\nperceived. Until it <em>is</em>, “having” appears to be the <em>opposite</em> of\n“being.” Therefore, the first lesson <em>seems</em> to contain a contradiction\nsince it is being learned <em>by a conflicted mind.</em> This <em>means</em>\nconflicting motivation, and so the lesson <em>cannot</em> be learned\nconsistently as yet. Further, the mind of the learner projects its own\nsplit, and thus does <em>not</em> perceive consistent minds in others, making\nhim suspicious of <em>their</em> motivation. This is the real reason why in\nmany respects the first lesson is the hardest to learn. Still strongly\naware of the ego in himself and responding primarily to the ego in\nothers, he is being taught to react to both as if what he <em>does</em> believe\nis <em>not</em> true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> Upside-down as always, the ego perceives the first lesson as insane.\nIn fact this is its only alternative here since the other one, which\nwould be much <em>less</em> acceptable to it, would obviously be that <em>it</em> is\ninsane. The ego’s judgment, then, is predetermined by what it <em>is</em>,\nthough no more so than is any other product of thought. The fundamental\nchange will still occur with the change of mind <em>in the thinker</em>.\nMeanwhile, the increasing clarity of the Holy Spirit’s Voice makes it\nimpossible for the learner <em>not</em> to listen. For a time, then, he <em>is</em>\nreceiving conflicting messages <em>and accepting both</em>. This is the classic\n“double bind” in communication.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> The way <em>out</em> of conflict between two opposing thought systems is\nclearly <em>to choose one</em> and <em>relinquish the other.</em> If you <em>identify</em>\nwith your thought system, and you cannot escape this, and if you accept\ntwo thought systems which are in <em>complete</em> disagreement, peace of mind\n<em>is</em> impossible. If you <em>teach</em> both, which you will surely do as long\nas you <em>accept</em> both, you are teaching conflict and <em>learning</em> it. Yet\nyou <em>do</em> want peace, or you would not have called upon the Voice for\nPeace to help you. His <em>lesson</em> is not insane; the <em>conflict</em> is.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> There can <em>be</em> no conflict between sanity and insanity. Only one is\ntrue, and therefore only one is <em>real</em>. The ego tries to persuade <em>you</em>\nthat it is up to you to decide which voice is true, but the Holy Spirit\nteaches you that truth was created by God, and <em>your</em> decision <em>cannot</em>\nchange it. As you begin to realize the quiet power of the Holy Spirit’s\nVoice <em>and its perfect consistency</em>, it <em>must</em> dawn on your minds that\nyou are trying to undo a decision which was made irrevocably <em>for</em> you.\nThat is why we suggested before that there was help in reminding\nyourselves to allow the Holy Spirit to decide for God for <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> You are <em>not</em> asked to make insane decisions, although you are free\nto <em>think</em> you are. It <em>must</em>, however, be insane to believe that it <em>is\nup to you</em> to decide what God’s creations <em>are</em>. The Holy Spirit\nperceives the conflict exactly as it is. Therefore, His second lesson\nis:</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> <em>To <strong>have</strong> peace, <strong>teach</strong> peace to <strong>learn</strong> it</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> This is still a preliminary step since <em>having</em> and <em>being</em> are still\nnot equated. It is, however, more advanced than the first step, which is\nreally only a thought <em>reversal.</em> The second step is a positive\naffirmation of <em>what you want.</em> This, then, is a step in the direction\n<em>out</em> of conflict since it means that alternatives have been considered\nand <em>one</em> has been chosen as <em>more desirable.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> Nevertheless, the evaluation “more desirable” still implies that the\ndesirable has <em>degrees.</em> Therefore, although this step is essential for\nthe ultimate decision, it is clearly <em>not</em> the final one. It is clear at\nthis point that the lack of order of difficulty in miracles has not yet\nbeen accepted, because nothing is difficult that is <em>wholly</em> <em>desired</em>.\nTo desire wholly is to <em>create</em>, and creating <em>cannot</em> be difficult if\nGod Himself created you <em>as</em> a creator. The second step, then, is still\nperceptual, although it is a giant step toward the unified perception\nwhich parallels God’s knowing.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> As you take this step and <em>hold this direction</em>, you will be pushing\ntoward the center of your thought system where the <em>fundamental</em> change\nwill occur. You are only beginning this step now, but you have started\non this way by realizing that <em>only one way is possible</em>. You do not yet\nrealize this consistently, and so your progress is intermittent, but the\nsecond step is easier than the first because it <em>follows</em>. The very fact\nthat you have accepted <em>that</em> is a demonstration of your growing\nawareness that the Holy Spirit <em>will</em> lead you on.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"c-be-vigilant-only-for-god-and-his-kingdom\">c. Be Vigilant Only for God and His Kingdom</h2>\n\n<p><sup>82</sup> For your own salvation you must be critical, since your salvation\n<em>is</em> critical to the whole Sonship. We said before that the Holy Spirit\nis evaluative and <em>must</em> be. Yet His evaluation does not extend <em>beyond</em>\nyou, or you would share it. In <em>your</em> mind, and your mind <em>only</em>, He\nsorts out the true from the false and teaches you to judge every thought\nthat you allow to enter your mind in the light of what God <em>put</em> there.\nWhatever is <em>in accord</em> with this light, He retains to strengthen the\nKingdom in <em>you.</em> What is <em>partly</em> in accord with truth, He accepts and\npurifies. But what is <em>out of accord</em> entirely, He rejects by judging\n<em>against.</em> This is how He keeps the Kingdom perfectly consistent and\nperfectly unified.</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> What you must remember, however, is that what the Holy Spirit\nrejects, the ego <em>accepts</em>. This is because they are in fundamental\ndisagreement about everything, being in fundamental disagreement about\n<em>what you are</em>. The ego’s beliefs on this crucial issue vary, and that\nis why it promotes different moods. The Holy Spirit <em>never</em> varies on\nthis point, and so the <em>one</em> mood He engenders is joy. He <em>protects</em> it\nby rejecting everything that does <em>not</em> foster joy, and so He alone can\nkeep you wholly joyous.</p>\n\n<p><sup>84</sup> The Holy Spirit does not teach your mind to be critical of other\nminds, because He does not want you to teach errors <em>and learn them\nyourselves</em>. He would hardly be consistent if He allowed you to\n<em>strengthen</em> what you must learn to <em>avoid</em>. In the mind of the\n<em>thinker</em>, then, He <em>is</em> judgmental, but only in order to unify the mind\nso it can perceive <em>without</em> judgment. This enables the mind to <em>teach</em>\nwithout judgment and therefore to learn to <em>be</em> without judgment. The\nundoing is necessary only in <em>your</em> mind so that you cannot project\nfalsely. God Himself has established what you can project with perfect\nsafety. Therefore, the Holy Spirit’s third lesson is:</p>\n\n<p><sup>85</sup> <em>Be vigilant <strong>only</strong> for God and <strong>His</strong> Kingdom</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>86</sup> This is a major step toward <em>fundamental</em> change. Yet it is still a\nlesson in thought reversal since it implies that there is something you\nmust be vigilant <em>against</em>. It has advanced far from the first lesson,\nwhich was <em>primarily</em> a reversal and also from the second, which was\nessentially the identification of what is <em>more</em> desirable. <em>This</em> step,\nwhich follows from the second as the second follows from the first,\nemphasizes the <em>dichotomy</em> between the desirable and the undesirable. It\ntherefore makes the <em>ultimate</em> choice inevitable.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> While the first step seems to <em>increase</em> conflict and the second step\nstill entails it to some extent, this one calls for <em>consistent effort\nagainst it</em>. We said already that you can be as vigilant <em>against</em> the\nego as <em>for</em> it. This lesson teaches not only that you <em>can</em> be, but\nthat you <em>must</em> be. It does not concern itself with order of difficulty\nbut with <em>clear cut priority for vigilance</em>. This step is unequivocal in\nthat it teaches there must be <em>no</em> exceptions, although it does not deny\nthat the temptation to <em>make</em> exceptions will occur. Here, then, your\nconsistency is called on <em>despite</em> chaos. Yet chaos and consistency\n<em>cannot</em> coexist for long, since they are mutually exclusive.</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> As long as you must be vigilant against anything, however, you are\nnot recognizing this mutual exclusiveness and are holding the belief\nthat you can <em>choose either one</em>. By teaching <em>what</em> to choose, the Holy\nSpirit will ultimately be able to teach you that <em>you need not choose at\nall</em>. This will finally liberate your will <em>from</em> choice and direct it\ntowards creation <em>within</em> the Kingdom. Choosing through the Holy Spirit\nwill lead you <em>to</em> the Kingdom. You create by what you <em>are</em>, but this\nis what you must learn. The way to learn it is inherent in the third\nstep, which brings together the lessons implied in the others and goes\nbeyond them towards real integration.</p>\n\n<p><sup>89</sup> If you allow yourselves to have in your minds <em>only</em> what God put\nthere, you <em>are</em> acknowledging your mind as God created it. Therefore,\nyou are accepting it <em>as it is</em>. Since it is whole, you are teaching\npeace <em>because</em> you believe in it. The final step will still be taken\n<em>for</em> you by God, but by the third step the Holy Spirit has <em>prepared</em>\nyou for God. He is <em>getting you ready</em> for the translation of having\ninto being by the very nature of the steps you must take with Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>90</sup> You learn first that having rests on <em>giving</em> and <em>not</em> on getting.\nNext you learn that you learn what you <em>teach</em> and that you <em>want to\nlearn peace</em>. This is the <em>condition</em> for identifying with the Kingdom\nsince it is the condition <em>of</em> the Kingdom. You have believed that you\nare <em>without</em> the Kingdom and have therefore excluded yourself <em>from</em> it\nin your belief. It is therefore essential to teach you that you must be\n<em>included</em> and that the <em>belief</em> that you are <em>not</em> is the <em>only</em> thing\nthat you must exclude.</p>\n\n<p><sup>91</sup> The third step is thus one of <em>protection</em> for your minds, allowing\nyou to identify <em>only</em> with the center, where God placed the altar to\nHimself. We have already said that altars are beliefs, but God and His\ncreations are <em>beyond</em> belief, because they are beyond question. The\nVoice for God speaks only for <em>belief</em> beyond question, which is the\npreparation for <em>being</em> without question. As long as belief in God and\nHis Kingdom is assailed by <em>any</em> doubts in your minds, His perfect\naccomplishment is <em>not</em> apparent to you. This is why you must be\nvigilant <em>on God’s behalf</em>. The ego speaks <em>against</em> His creation and\ntherefore <em>does</em> engender doubt. You cannot go <em>beyond</em> belief until you\nbelieve fully.</p>\n\n<p><sup>92</sup> Transfer, which <em>is</em> extension, is a measure of learning, because it\nis its <em>measurable result.</em> This, however, does not mean that what it\ntransfers <em>to</em> is measurable. On the contrary, unless it transfers to\nthe whole Sonship, which is immeasurable because it was created <em>by</em> the\nImmeasurable, the learning itself <em>must</em> be incomplete. To teach the\nwhole Sonship <em>without exception</em> demonstrates that you <em>perceive</em> its\nwholeness and have learned that it <em>is</em> one. Now you must be vigilant to\n<em>hold</em> its oneness in your minds because, if you let doubt enter, you\nwill lose awareness of its wholeness <em>and will be unable to teach it</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>93</sup> The wholeness of the Kingdom does <em>not</em> depend on your perception,\nbut your <em>awareness</em> of its wholeness <em>does</em>. It is only your awareness\nwhich <em>needs</em> protection since your being cannot <em>be</em> assailed. Yet a\nreal sense of being <em>cannot</em> be yours while you are doubtful of what you\n<em>are</em>. <em>This is why vigilance is essential</em>. Doubts about being must not\nenter your mind, or you <em>cannot</em> know what you are with certainty.\nCertainty is <em>of</em> God for <em>you</em>. Vigilance is not necessary for truth,\nbut it <em>is</em> necessary against <em>illusions</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>94</sup> Truth is <em>without</em> illusions and therefore <em>within</em> the Kingdom.\nEverything <em>outside</em> the Kingdom <em>is</em> illusion, but you must learn to\naccept truth, because you threw it away. You therefore saw yourself <em>as\nif</em> you were without it. By making another Kingdom which you <em>valued</em>,\nyou did not keep <em>only</em> the Kingdom of God in your minds and thus placed\npart of your mind <em>outside</em> it. What you have made has thus divided your\nwill and given you a sick mind which <em>must</em> be healed. Your vigilance\n<em>against</em> this sickness <em>is</em> the way to heal it. Once your mind is\nhealed, it radiates health and thereby <em>teaches</em> healing. This\nestablishes you as a teacher who teaches like me. Vigilance was required\nof me as much as of you, but remember that those who will to teach the\nsame thing must be in agreement about what they believe.</p>\n\n<p><sup>95</sup> The third step, then, is a statement of what you <em>want</em> to believe\nand entails a willingness <em>to relinquish everything else</em>. I told you\nthat you were just beginning the second step, but I also told you that\nthe third one <em>follows</em> it. The Holy Spirit will enable you to go on if\nyou follow Him. Your vigilance is the sign that you <em>want</em> Him to guide\nyou. Vigilance does require effort, but only to teach you that effort\n<em>itself</em> is unnecessary. You have exerted great effort to preserve what\nyou made <em>because</em> it was not true. Therefore, you must now turn your\neffort <em>against</em> it. Only this can cancel out the <em>need</em> for effort and\ncall upon the <em>being</em> which you both <em>have</em> and <em>are</em>. <em>This</em>\nrecognition is wholly <em>without</em> effort since it is <em>already</em> true and\n<em>needs</em> no protection. It is in the perfect safety of God. Therefore\ninclusion is total and creation is without limit.</p>\n\n",

To bargain is to limit giving, and\nthis is not God’s Will. To will with God is to create like Him.

Only joy increases forever, since joy and eternity\nare inseparable.

To\nthis the Holy Spirit leads you that your joy may be complete, because\nthe Kingdom of God is whole. We have said that the last step in the\nreawakening of knowledge is taken by God. This is true, but it is hard\nto explain in words because words are symbols, and nothing that is true\n<em>needs</em> to be explained. However, the Holy Spirit has the task of\ntranslating the use<em>less</em> into the use<em>ful</em>, the meaning<em>less</em> into the\nmeaning<em>ful</em>, and the temporary into the timeless. He <em>can</em> therefore\ntell you something about this last step, although this one you must know\nyourself, since <em>by</em> it you know what you are. This <em>is</em> your being.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> God does not <em>take</em> steps, because His accomplishments are not\ngradual. He does not teach, because His creations are changeless. He\ndoes nothing <em>last</em>, because He created <em>first</em> and <em>for always</em>. It\nmust be understood that the word “first” as applied to Him is <em>not</em> a\ntime concept. He is first in the sense that He is the first in the Holy\nTrinity itself. He is the Prime Creator, because He created His\nco-creators. <em>Because</em> He did, time applies neither to Him <em>nor</em> to what\nHe created. The “last step” that God [was said to] take was therefore\ntrue in the beginning, is true now, and will be true forever.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> What is timeless is <em>always</em> there, because its <em>being</em> is eternally\nchangeless. It does not change by increase, because it was forever\ncreated <em>to</em> increase. If you perceive it as <em>not</em> increasing, you do\nnot know what it <em>is</em>. You also do not know what created it or Who <em>He</em>\nis. God does not <em>reveal</em> this to you, because it was never hidden.

    "content": "<p><sup>10</sup> To heal, then, is to correct perception in your brother <em>and</em>\nyourself by sharing the Holy Spirit with him. This places you <em>both</em>\nwithin the Kingdom and restores its wholeness in your minds. This\nparallels creation, because it <em>unifies by increasing</em> and <em>integrates\nby extending</em>. What you project you believe. This is an immutable law of\nthe mind in this world as well as in the Kingdom. However, the content\nis different in this world, because the thoughts it governs are very\ndifferent from the thoughts in the Kingdom. Laws must be adapted to\ncircumstances if they are to maintain order.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> The outstanding characteristic of the laws of mind as they operate in\nthis world is that by obeying them—and I assure you that you <em>must</em> obey\nthem—you can arrive at diametrically opposed results. This is because\nthe laws have adapted to the circumstances of this world, in which\ndiametrically opposed outcomes <em>are</em> believed in. The laws of mind\ngovern thoughts, and you <em>do</em> respond to two conflicting voices. You\nhave heard many arguments on behalf of “the freedoms,” which would\nindeed have been freedom if man had not chosen to <em>fight</em> for them. That\nis why they perceive “the freedoms” as many instead of as one. Yet the\nargument that underlies the defense of freedom is perfectly valid.\nBecause it is true, it should not be <em>fought</em> for, but it <em>should</em> be\nsided <em>with</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> Those who are against freedom believe that its outcome will <em>hurt</em>\nthem, which <em>cannot</em> be true. But those who are <em>for</em> freedom, even if\nthey are misguided in how [they] defend it, are siding with the one\nthing in this world which <em>is</em> true. Whenever anyone can listen fairly\nto both sides of <em>any</em> issue, he will make the right decision. This is\nbecause he <em>has</em> the answer. Conflict can <em>seem</em> to be interpersonal,\nbut it <em>must</em> be intrapersonal first.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> The term “intrapersonal” is an ego term, because “personal” implies\n“of <em>one</em> person” and <em>not</em> of others. “Interpersonal” has a similar\nerror in that it refers to something that exists among different or\n<em>separate</em> people. When we spoke before of the extremely <em>personal</em>\nnature of revelation, we followed this statement immediately with a\ndescription of the inevitable outcomes of the revelation in terms of\n<em>sharing</em>. A person conceives of himself as separate largely because he\nperceives <em>of</em> himself as bounded by a body. <em>Only</em> if he perceives\nhimself as a <em>mind</em> can [he overcome this]. Then he is free to use\nterms like “intramental” and “intermental” <em>without</em> seeing them as\ndifferent [and] conflicting, because minds <em>can</em> be in perfect accord.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> <em>Outside</em> the Kingdom, the law which prevails <em>inside</em> it is adapted\nto “what you project you <em>believe</em>.” This is its <em>teaching</em> form, since\noutside the Kingdom teaching is mandatory, because <em>learning</em> is\nessential. This form of the law clearly implies that you will learn what\n<em>you</em> are from what you have projected onto others and therefore believe\n<em>they</em> are. <em>In</em> the Kingdom there is no teaching <em>or</em> learning, because\nthere is no <em>belief</em>. There is only <em>certainty.</em> God and His Sons, in\nthe surety of being, <em>know</em> that what you project you <em>are</em>. That form\nof the law is not adapted at all, being the law of creation. God Himself\ncreated the law by creating <em>by</em> it. And His Sons, who create like Him,\nfollow it gladly, knowing that the increase of the Kingdom depends on\nit, just as their own creation did.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> Laws must be communicated if they are to be helpful. In effect, they\nmust be <em>translated</em> for those who speak a different language.\nNevertheless, a good translator, although he must alter the <em>form</em> of\nwhat he translates, <em>never</em> changes the meaning. In fact, his whole\npurpose is to change the form <em>so that</em> the original meaning is\nretained. The Holy Spirit is the <em>translator</em> of the laws of God to\nthose who do <em>not</em> understand them. You could not do this yourselves,\nbecause conflicted minds <em>cannot</em> be faithful to one meaning and will\ntherefore <em>change the meaning to preserve the form</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> The Holy Spirit’s purpose in translating is naturally <em>exactly</em> the\nopposite. He translates only to <em>preserve</em> the original meaning in <em>all</em>\nrespects and in <em>all</em> languages. Therefore, He opposes differences in\nform as meaningful, emphasizing always that <em>these differences do not\nmatter</em>. The meaning of His message is <em>always</em> the same, and <em>only</em> the\nmeaning matters. God’s law of Creation in perfect form does not involve\nthe <em>use</em> of truth to convince His Sons <em>of</em> truth. The <em>extension</em> of\ntruth, which <em>is</em> the law of the Kingdom, rests only on the knowledge of\nwhat truth <em>is.</em> This is your inheritance and requires no learning at\nall, but when you <em>dis</em>inherited yourselves, you <em>became</em> learners.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> No one questions the intimate connection of learning and memory.\nLearning is impossible <em>without</em> memory, since it cannot be consistent\n<em>unless</em> it is remembered. That is why the Holy Spirit <em>is</em> a lesson in\nremembering. We said before that He teaches remembering and forgetting,\nbut the forgetting aspect is only <em>to make the remembering consistent</em>.\nYou forget in order to <em>remember better</em>. You will <em>not</em> understand His\ntranslations while you listen to two ways of perceiving them. Therefore,\nyou must forget or relinquish one to <em>understand</em> the other. This is the\nonly way you <em>can</em> learn consistency so that you can finally <em>be</em>\nconsistent.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> What can the perfect consistency of the Kingdom mean to the confused?\nIt is apparent that confusion <em>interferes</em> with meaning and therefore\n<em>prevents the learner from appreciating</em> it. There is <em>no</em> confusion in\nthe Kingdom, because there is only <em>one</em> meaning. This meaning comes\nfrom God and <em>is</em> God. Because it is also <em>you</em>, you share it and\n<em>extend</em> it as your Creator did. This needs no translation, because it\nis perfectly understood, but it <em>does</em> need extension because it <em>means</em>\nextension. Communication is perfectly direct and perfectly united. It is\ntotally without strain, because nothing discordant <em>ever</em> enters. That\nis why it <em>is</em> the Kingdom of God. It belongs to Him and is therefore\n<em>like</em> Him. That is its reality, and nothing <em>can</em> assail it.</p>\n\n",

It is true that if you put three apples on the table and\nthen take them away, the three apples are not there. But it is <em>not</em>\ntrue that the table is now <em>minus</em> three apples. If there is <em>nothing</em>\non the table, it does not matter what <em>was</em> there in terms of amount.\nThe “nothing” is neither greater nor less because of what is absent.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> That is why “all” and “nothing” are dichotomous, <em>without</em> a range.\nThis is perfectly clear in considering psychological tests of maximal\nperformance. You cannot interpret the results <em>at all</em> unless you assume\neither <em>maximal</em> motivation or <em>no</em> motivation at all. Only in these two\nconditions can you validly compare responses, and you <em>must</em> assume the\nformer, because if the latter were true, the subject would not do\n<em>anything</em>. Given <em>variable</em> motivation, he <em>will</em> do something, but\n<em>you</em> cannot understand <em>what it is</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> The results of such tests are evaluated relatively <em>assuming</em> maximal\nmotivation, but this is because we are dealing with <em>abilities</em>, where\ndegree of development is meaningful. This does <em>not</em> mean that what the\nability is used <em>for</em> is necessarily either limited <em>or</em> divided. Yet\none thing is certain—abilities are <em>potentials</em> for learning, and you\nwill apply them to what you <em>want</em> to learn. Learning is <em>effort</em>, and\neffort means <em>will.</em> We have used the term “abilities” in the plural,\nbecause abilities began with the ego, which perceived them as\n<em>potentials for excelling</em>. This is how the ego <em>still</em> perceives them\nand uses them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> The ego does not <em>want</em> to teach everyone all it has learned, because\nthat would <em>defeat</em> its purpose. Therefore, it does not <em>really</em> learn\nat all. The Holy Spirit teaches you to use what the ego has made to\nteach the <em>opposite</em> of what the ego has learned. The <em>kind</em> of learning\nis as irrelevant as is the particular ability which was applied <em>to</em> the\nlearning. You could not have a better example of the Holy Spirit’s\nunified purpose than this course. The Holy Spirit has taken very\ndiversified areas of <em>your</em> learning and has applied them to a <em>unified</em>\ncurriculum. The fact that this was <em>not</em> the ego’s reason for learning\nis totally irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> <em>You</em> made the effort to learn, and the Holy Spirit has a unified\ngoal for <em>all</em> effort. He <em>adapts</em> the ego’s potentials for excelling to\npotentials for <em>equalizing</em>. This makes them <em>useless</em> for the ego’s\npurpose but <em>very</em> useful for His. If different abilities are applied\nlong enough to one goal, the abilities <em>themselves</em> become unified. This\nis because they are channelized in one direction or in one <em>way</em>.\nUltimately, then, they all contribute to <em>one result</em>, and by so doing,\ntheir similarity rather than their differences is emphasized. You can\n<em>excel</em> in many <em>different</em> ways, but you can <em>equalize</em> in <em>one way\nonly</em>. Equality is <em>not</em> a variable state, by definition.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> That is why you will be able to perform <em>all</em> aspects of your work\nwith ease when you have learned <em>this</em> course. To the ego there appears\nto be no connection, because the <em>ego</em> is discontinuous. Yet the Holy\nSpirit teaches <em>one</em> lesson and applies it to <em>all</em> individuals in <em>all</em>\nsituations. Being conflict-free, He maximizes <em>all</em> efforts and <em>all</em>\nresults. By teaching the power of the Kingdom of God Himself, He teaches\nyou that <em>all power is yours</em>. Its application does not matter. It is\n<em>always</em> maximal. Your vigilance does not <em>establish</em> it as yours, but\nit <em>does</em> enable you to use it <em>always</em> and in <em>all ways.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> When I said, “I am with you always,” I meant it literally. I am not\nabsent to <em>anyone</em> in <em>any</em> situation. <em>Because</em> I am always with you,\n<em>you</em> are the way and the truth and the light. You did not make this\npower, any more than I did. It was created to <em>be</em> shared and therefore\ncannot be meaningfully perceived as belonging to anyone <em>at the expense</em>\nof another. Such a perception makes it meaningless by eliminating or\noverlooking its <em>real</em> and <em>only</em> meaning.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>26</sup> God’s meaning waits in the Kingdom, because that is where He placed\nit. It does not wait in time. It merely <em>rests</em> in the Kingdom, because\nit <em>belongs</em> there, as you do. How can you, who <em>are</em> God’s meaning,\nperceive yourselves as absent <em>from</em> it? You can see yourselves as\nseparated from your meaning only <em>by experiencing yourself as unreal</em>.\nThis is why the ego is insane; it teaches that you are <em>not</em> what you\n<em>are.</em> This is so contradictory that it is clearly impossible. It is\ntherefore a lesson which you <em>cannot really learn</em>, and therefore\n<em>cannot really teach</em>. Yet you are always teaching. You <em>must</em> therefore\nbe teaching something <em>else</em> as well, even though the ego <em>does not know\nwhat it is</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> The ego, then, <em>is</em> always being undone and <em>does</em> suspect your\nmotives. Your mind <em>cannot</em> be unified in allegiance to the ego, because\nthe mind does <em>not</em> belong to it. Yet what is “treacherous” to the ego\n<em>is</em> faithful to peace. The ego’s “enemy” is therefore <em>your</em> friend. We\nsaid before that the ego’s friend is not part of you, since the ego\nperceives itself as at war and therefore in need of allies. <em>You</em> who\nare <em>not</em> at war must look for brothers and <em>recognize</em> all whom you see\n<em>as</em> brothers, because <em>only</em> equals are at peace.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> Because God’s equal Sons have everything, they <em>cannot</em> compete. Yet\nif they perceive <em>any</em> of their brothers as anything other than their\nperfect equals, the idea of competition <em>has</em> entered their minds. Do\nnot underestimate your need to be vigilant <em>against</em> this idea, because\n<em>all</em> your conflicts come from it. It is the belief that conflicting\ninterests are possible, and therefore you have accepted the impossible\nas <em>true</em>. How is that different from saying that you are perceiving\n<em>yourself</em> as unreal?</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> To be <em>in</em> the Kingdom is merely to focus your full attention <em>on</em>\nit. As long as you believe that you can attend to what is not true, you\nare accepting conflict as your <em>choice</em>. Is it <em>really</em> a choice? It\n<em>seems</em> to be, but seeming and reality are hardly the same. You who\n<em>are</em> the Kingdom are not concerned with seeming. Reality is yours,\nbecause you <em>are</em> reality. This is how having and being are ultimately\nreconciled, not in the Kingdom, but <em>in your minds</em>. The altar there is\nthe <em>only</em> reality. The altar is perfectly clear in thought, because it\nis a reflection of <em>perfect</em> Thought. It sees only brothers, because it\nsees <em>only</em> in its own light.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> God has lit your minds Himself and keeps your minds lit by His light,\nbecause His light is what your minds <em>are</em>. This is <em>totally</em> beyond\nquestion, and when you questioned it you <em>were</em> answered. The answer\nmerely <em>undoes</em> the question by establishing the fact that to question\nreality is to question meaninglessly. That is why the Holy Spirit\n<em>never</em> questions. His sole function is to <em>undo</em> the questionable and\nthus lead to <em>certainty</em>. The certain are perfectly calm, because they\nare not in doubt. They do not raise questions, because nothing\nquestionable <em>enters</em> their minds. This holds them in perfect serenity,\nbecause this is what they share, <em>knowing</em> what they are.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> As has so often been said, healing is both an art and a science. It\nis an art, because it depends on inspiration in the sense that we have\nalready used the term. Inspiration is the opposite of dispiriting and\ntherefore means to make joyous. The dispirited are depressed, because\nthey believe that they are literally “without the Spirit,” which is an\nillusion. You do not <em>put</em> the Spirit in them by inspiring them, because\nthat would be magic and therefore would not be real healing. You <em>do</em>,\nhowever, recognize the Spirit that is <em>already</em> there and thereby\n<em>reawaken</em> it. This is why the healer is part of the resurrection and\nthe <em>life.</em> The Spirit is not asleep in the minds of the sick, but the\npart of the mind that can perceive it and be glad <em>is</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> Healing is also a science, because it obeys the laws of God, Whose\nlaws are true. <em>Because</em> they are true, they are perfectly dependable\nand therefore universal in application. The <em>real</em> aim of science is\nneither prediction nor control but <em>only</em> understanding. This is because\nit does <em>not</em> establish the laws it seeks, <em>cannot</em> discover them\nthrough prediction, and has <em>no</em> control over them at all. Science is\nnothing more than an approach to <em>what already is</em>. Like inspiration it\ncan be misunderstood as magic and <em>will</em> be whenever it is undertaken as\n<em>separate</em> from what already is and perceived as a means for\n<em>establishing</em> it. To believe this is possible is to believe <em>you can do\nit</em>. This can <em>only</em> be the voice of the ego.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> Truth can only be <em>recognized</em> and <em>need</em> only be recognized.\nInspiration is of the Spirit, and certainty is of God according to His\nlaws. Both, therefore, come from the same Source, [because]\ninspiration comes from the Voice <em>for</em> God, and certainty comes from the\nlaws <em>of</em> God. Healing does not come <em>directly</em> from God, Who knows His\ncreations as perfectly whole. Yet healing is [nevertheless] <em>of</em> God,\nbecause it proceeds from His Voice and from His laws. It is their\nresult, in a state of mind which does <em>not</em> know Him. The <em>state</em> is\nunknown to Him and therefore does not exist, but those who sleep <em>are</em>\nstupefied, or better, <em>unaware</em>. [<em>And because</em>] they are unaware,\nthey do <em>not</em> know.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> The Holy Spirit must work <em>through</em> you to teach you He is <em>in</em> you.\nThis is an intermediary step toward the knowledge that you are in God,\nbecause you are part of Him. The miracles which the Holy Spirit inspires\ncan have no order of difficulty, because every part of creation is of\n<em>one</em> order. This is God’s <em>Will and yours</em>. The laws of God <em>establish</em>\nthis, and the Holy Spirit reminds you <em>of</em> it. When you heal, you are\n<em>remembering</em> the laws of God and forgetting the laws of the ego. We\nsaid before that forgetting is merely a way of remembering <em>better.</em> It\nis therefore <em>not</em> the opposite of remembering, when it is properly\nperceived. Perceived <em>improperly</em>, it induces a perception of <em>conflict</em>\nwith something <em>else</em>, as all incorrect perception does. <em>Properly</em>\nperceived, it can be used as a way <em>out</em> of conflict, as all proper\nperception can.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> <em>All</em> abilities, then, should be given over to the Holy Spirit, <em>Who\nknows how to use them properly.</em> He can use them <em>only</em> for healing,\nbecause He knows you <em>only</em> as whole. <em>By</em> healing you learn of\nwholeness, and by learning of wholeness you learn to remember God. You\n<em>have</em> forgotten Him, but the Holy Spirit still knows that your\nforgetting must be translated into a way of <em>remembering</em> and <em>not</em>\nperceived as a separate ability which opposes an opposite. That is the\nway in which the ego tries to use <em>all</em> abilities, since its goal is\nalways to make you believe that <em>you</em> are in opposition.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> The ego’s goal is as unified as the Holy Spirit’s, and it is because\nof this that their goals can <em>never</em> be reconciled in <em>any</em> way or to\n<em>any</em> extent. The ego <em>always</em> seeks to divide and separate. The Holy\nSpirit <em>always</em> seeks to unify and heal. As you heal you <em>are</em> healed,\nbecause the Holy Spirit sees no order of healing. Healing is the way to\n<em>undo</em> the belief in differences, being the <em>only</em> way of perceiving the\nSonship without this belief. This perception is therefore <em>in</em> accord\nwith the laws of God, even in a state of mind which is <em>out</em> of accord\nwith His. The strength of right perception is so great that it brings\nthe mind <em>into</em> accord with His, because it yields to His pull which is\nin all of you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> To <em>oppose</em> the pull or the Will of God is not an ability but a real\n<em>delusion</em>. The ego believes that it <em>has</em> this ability and can offer it\nto you as a gift. <em>You do not want it</em>. It is <em>not</em> a gift. It is\n<em>nothing at all</em>. God has given you a gift which you both have and are.\nWhen you do not use it, you do not know you <em>have</em> it. By <em>not</em> knowing\nthis, you do not know what you are. Healing, then, is a way of\n<em>approaching</em> knowledge by thinking <em>in accordance</em> with the laws of God\nand recognizing their <em>universality</em>. Without this recognition, you have\nmade the laws themselves meaningless to you. Yet the <em>laws</em> are not\nmeaningless, since all meaning is contained <em>by</em> them and <em>in</em> them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> Seek ye <em>first</em> the Kingdom of Heaven, because that is where the laws\nof God operate truly, and they can operate <em>only</em> truly since they are\nthe laws of Truth. But seek this <em>only</em> because you can <em>find</em> nothing\nelse. There <em>is</em> nothing else. God is all in all in a very literal\nsense. All being is in Him who <em>is</em> all Being. <em>You</em> are therefore in\nHim since <em>your</em> being <em>is</em> His. Healing is a way of forgetting the\nsense of danger the ego has induced in <em>you</em> by <em>not</em> recognizing its\nexistence in your brothers. This strengthens the Holy Spirit in <em>both</em>\nof you, because it is a <em>refusal</em> to acknowledge fear. Love needs only\nthis invitation. It comes freely to <em>all</em> the Sonship, being what the\nSonship <em>is</em>. By your awakening <em>to</em> it, you are merely forgetting what\nyou are <em>not</em>. This enables you to remember what you <em>are</em>.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>39</sup> The body is nothing more than a framework for developing abilities.\nIt is therefore a means for developing <em>potentials</em>, which is quite\napart from what the potential is used <em>for</em>. <em>That</em> is a <em>decision</em>. The\neffects of the ego’s decision in this matter are so apparent that they\nneed no elaboration here, but the Holy Spirit’s decision to use the body\n<em>only</em> for communication has such a direct connection with healing that\nit <em>does</em> need clarification. The unhealed healer <em>obviously</em> does not\nunderstand his own vocation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> <em>Only</em> minds communicate. Since the ego <em>cannot</em> obliterate the\nimpulse to communicate because it is also the impulse to create, the ego\ncan only teach you that the <em>body</em> can both communicate <em>and</em> create and\ntherefore does not <em>need</em> the mind. The ego thus tries to teach you that\nthe body can <em>act</em> like the mind and is therefore self-sufficient. Yet\nwe have learned that behavior is <em>not</em> the level for either teaching\n<em>or</em> learning. This must be so, since you <em>can</em> act in accordance with\nwhat you do <em>not</em> believe. To do this, however, will weaken you as\nteachers <em>and</em> learners because, as has been repeatedly emphasized, you\nteach what you <em>do</em> believe. An inconsistent lesson will be poorly\ntaught <em>and poorly learned</em>. If you teach both sickness <em>and</em> healing,\nyou are both a poor teacher <em>and</em> a poor learner.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> Healing is the one ability which everyone can develop and <em>must</em>\ndevelop if he is to be healed. Healing is the Holy Spirit’s form of\ncommunication and the <em>only</em> one He knows. He recognizes no other,\nbecause He does not accept the ego’s confusion of mind and body. Minds\ncan communicate, but they <em>cannot</em> hurt. The body in the service of the\nego can hurt other <em>bodies</em>, but this cannot occur unless the body has\n<em>already</em> been confused with the mind. This fact, too, can be used\neither for healing or for magic, but you must remember that magic is\n<em>always</em> the belief that healing is <em>harmful</em>. This is its totally\ninsane premise, and so it proceeds accordingly.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> Healing only <em>strengthens</em>. Magic <em>always</em> tries to weaken. Healing\nperceives <em>nothing</em> in the healer that everyone else does not <em>share</em>\nwith him. Magic <em>always</em> sees something “special” in the healer which he\nbelieves he can offer as a gift to someone who does <em>not</em> have it. He\nmay believe that the gift comes <em>from</em> God to Him, but it is quite\nevident that he does not understand God if he thinks he has something\nthat others [<em>do not</em>]. You might well ask, then, why some healing\n<em>can</em> result from this kind of thinking, and there is a reason for this.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> However misguided the “magical healer” may be, he is <em>also</em> trying to\nhelp. He is conflicted and unstable, but <em>at times</em> he is offering\nsomething to the Sonship, and the only thing the Sonship can <em>accept</em> is\nhealing. When the so-called “healing” works, then, the impulse to help\nand to <em>be</em> helped have coincided. This is coincidental, because the\nhealer may <em>not</em> be experiencing himself as truly helpful at the time,\nbut the belief that he <em>is</em>, in the mind of another, helps <em>him</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> The Holy Spirit does <em>not</em> work by chance, and healing that is of Him\n<em>always</em> works. Unless the healer <em>always</em> heals by Him, the results\n<em>will</em> vary. Yet healing itself <em>is</em> consistence since <em>only</em>\nconsistence is conflict-free, and only the conflict-free <em>are</em> whole. By\naccepting exceptions and acknowledging that he can sometimes heal and\nsometimes not, the healer is <em>obviously</em> accepting inconsistency. He is\ntherefore <em>in</em> conflict and <em>teaching</em> conflict. Can anything of God\n<em>not</em> be for all and for always?</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> Love is incapable of <em>any</em> exceptions. Only if there is fear does the\n<em>idea</em> of exceptions seem to be meaningful. Exceptions are fearful,\nbecause they are made <em>by</em> fear. The “fearful healer” is a contradiction\nin terms and is therefore a concept which <em>only</em> a conflicted mind could\npossibly perceive as meaningful. Fear does <em>not</em> gladden. Healing\n<em>does</em>. Fear <em>always</em> makes exceptions. Healing <em>never</em> does. Fear\nproduces dissociation, because it induces <em>separation</em>. Healing <em>always</em>\nproduces harmony, because it proceeds from integration.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> Healing is predictable, because it can be counted on. <em>Everything</em>\nthat is of God can be counted on, because everything of God is wholly\n<em>real</em>. Healing can be counted on, <em>because</em> it is inspired by His Voice\nand is in accord with His laws. Yet if healing <em>is</em> consistence, it\ncannot be inconsistently understood. Understanding <em>means</em> consistence\nbecause God means consistence. Since that is <em>His</em> meaning, it is also\n<em>yours</em>. Your meaning cannot <em>be</em> out of accord with His because your\nwhole meaning, and your <em>only</em> meaning, comes <em>from</em> His and is <em>like</em>\nHis. God cannot be out of accord with <em>Himself</em>, and <em>you</em> cannot be out\nof accord with Him. You cannot separate your <em>self</em> from your Creator,\nWho created you by sharing <em>His</em> being <em>with</em> you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> The unhealed healer wants gratitude <em>from</em> his brothers, but he is\nnot grateful <em>to</em> them. This is because he thinks he is <em>giving</em>\nsomething <em>to</em> them and is <em>not</em> receiving something equally desirable\nin return. His <em>teaching</em> is limited, because he is <em>learning</em> so\nlittle. His healing lesson is limited by his own ingratitude, which is a\nlesson in <em>sickness</em>. Learning is constant and so vital in its power for\nchange that a Son of God can recognize his power in one instant and\nchange the world in the next. That is because by changing <em>his</em> mind he\nhas changed the most powerful device that was ever created <em>for</em> change.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> This in no way contradicts the changelessness of mind as <em>God</em>\ncreated it, but you think that you <em>have</em> changed it as long as you\nlearn through the ego. This <em>does</em> place you in a position of needing to\nlearn a lesson which seems contradictory—you must learn to change your\nmind <em>about</em> your mind. Only by this can you learn that it <em>is</em>\nchangeless. When you heal that is exactly what you <em>are</em> learning. You\nare recognizing the changeless mind in your brother by realizing that he\n<em>could</em> not have changed his mind. That is how you perceive the Holy\nSpirit in him. It is <em>only</em> the Holy Spirit in him that never changes\nHis Mind. He himself must think he <em>can</em>, or he would not perceive\nhimself as sick. He therefore does not know what his self <em>is</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> If <em>you</em> see only the changeless in him, you have not really changed\nhim at all. By changing <em>your</em> mind about his <em>for</em> him, you help him\n<em>undo</em> the change his ego thinks it has made in him. As you can hear two\nvoices, so you can see in two ways. One way shows you an image, or\nbetter, an idol which you may worship out of fear but which you will\nnever love. The other shows you only truth, which you will love, because\nyou will <em>understand</em> it. Understanding is <em>appreciation</em>, because what\nyou understand you can <em>identify</em> with, and by making it part of <em>you</em>,\nyou have accepted it with love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> That is how God Himself created <em>you</em>—in understanding, in\nappreciation, and in love. The ego is totally unable to understand this,\nbecause it does <em>not</em> understand what it makes; it does <em>not</em> appreciate\nit; and it does <em>not</em> love it. It incorporates to <em>take away.</em> It\nliterally believes that every time it deprives someone of something,\n<em>it</em> has increased. We have spoken often of the increase of the Kingdom\nby <em>your</em> creations, which can only be created as <em>you</em> were. The whole\nglory and perfect joy that <em>is</em> the Kingdom lies in you to give. Do you\nnot <em>want</em> to give it?</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> You <em>cannot</em> forget the Father, because I am with you, and <em>I</em> cannot\nforget Him. To forget <em>me</em> is to forget yourself and Him Who created\nyou. Our brothers <em>are</em> forgetful. That is why they need your\nremembrance of me and Him who created me. Through this remembrance, you\ncan change their minds about <em>themselves</em>, as I can change <em>yours.</em> Your\nminds are so powerful a light that you can look into theirs and\nenlighten them, as I can enlighten yours. I do not want to share my\n<em>body</em> in communion, because that is to share nothing. [Would I try to\nshare an illusion with the most holy children of a most holy Father?]\nYet I do want to share my <em>mind</em> with you, because we <em>are</em> of One Mind\nand that Mind <em>is</em> ours.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> See <em>only</em> this mind everywhere, because only this <em>is</em> everywhere\nand in everything. It <em>is</em> everything, because it encompasses all things\nwithin <em>itself</em>. Blessed are you who perceive only this, because you\nperceive only what is true. Come therefore unto me and learn of the\ntruth in <em>you</em>. The mind we share is shared by all our brothers, and as\nwe see them truly, they <em>will</em> be healed. Let <em>your</em> mind shine with\nmine upon their minds and by our gratitude to them make them aware of\nthe light in <em>them</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> This light will shine back upon <em>you</em> and on the whole Sonship,\nbecause this is your proper gift to God. He will accept it and give it\nto the Sonship, because it is acceptable to Him and therefore to His\nSons. This is the true communion of the Spirit, Who sees the altar of\nGod in everyone and, by bringing it to <em>your</em> appreciation, calls upon\nyou to love God <em>and</em> His creations. You can appreciate the Sonship\n<em>only</em> as one. This is part of the Law of Creation and therefore governs\n<em>all</em> thought.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>54</sup> Although you can <em>love</em> the Sonship only as one, you can <em>perceive</em>\nit as fragmented. It is impossible, however, for you to see something in\n<em>part</em> of it that you will not attribute to <em>all</em> of it. That is why\nattack is <em>never</em> discrete and why attack must be relinquished\n<em>entirely</em>. If it is <em>not</em> relinquished entirely, it is not relinquished\nat all. Fear and love are equally reciprocal. They make or create,\ndepending on whether the ego or the Holy Spirit begets or inspires them,\nbut they <em>will</em> return to the mind of the thinker, and they <em>will</em>\naffect his total perception. That includes his perception of God, of His\ncreations, and of his own. He will not appreciate <em>any</em> of them if he\nregards them fearfully. He will appreciate <em>all</em> of them if he regards\nthem with love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> The mind that accepts attack <em>cannot</em> love. That is because it\nbelieves that it can <em>destroy</em> love and therefore does not understand\nwhat love <em>is.</em> If it does not understand what love is, it <em>cannot</em>\nperceive itself as loving. This loses the awareness of being, induces\nfeelings of unreality, and results in utter confusion. Your own thinking\nhas done this because of its power, but your own thinking can also save\nyou <em>from</em> this, because its power is <em>not</em> of your making. Your ability\nto <em>direct</em> your thinking as you will is <em>part</em> of its power. If you do\nnot believe you can do this, you have <em>denied</em> the power of your thought\nand thus rendered it powerless in your <em>belief.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> The ingeniousness of the ego to preserve itself is enormous, but it\nstems from the power of the mind, which the ego <em>denies</em>. This means\nthat the ego <em>attacks</em> what is <em>preserving</em> it, and this <em>must</em> be a\nsource of extreme anxiety. That is why the ego <em>never</em> knows what it is\ndoing. It is perfectly logical but clearly insane. The ego draws upon\nthe one source which is totally inimical to its existence <em>for</em> its\nexistence. Fearful of perceiving the <em>power</em> of this source, it is\nforced to depreciate it. This threatens its <em>own</em> existence, a state\nwhich it finds intolerable.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> Remaining logical but still insane, the ego resolves this completely\ninsane dilemma in a completely insane way. It does not perceive <em>its</em>\nexistence as threatened by projecting the threat onto <em>you</em> and\nperceiving your <em>being</em> as nonexistent. This ensures <em>its</em> continuance\nif you side with it by guaranteeing that you will not know your <em>own</em>\nsafety. The ego cannot afford to know <em>anything</em>. Knowledge is total,\nand the ego does not <em>believe</em> in totality. This unbelief is its origin\nand, while the ego does not love <em>you</em>, it <em>is</em> faithful to its own\nantecedents, begetting as it was begotten.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> Mind <em>always</em> reproduces as it was produced. Produced by fear, the\nego reproduces fear. This is its allegiance, and this allegiance makes\nit treacherous to love, <em>because</em> you are love. Love is your power,\nwhich the ego must deny. It must also deny everything which this power\ngives you, because it gives you <em>everything</em>. No one who has everything\n<em>wants</em> the ego. Its own maker, then, does not want it. Rejection is\ntherefore the only decision which the ego could possibly encounter, if\nthe mind which made it knew <em>itself</em>. And if it recognized <em>any</em> part of\nthe Sonship, it <em>would</em> know itself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> The ego therefore opposes <em>all</em> appreciation, <em>all</em> recognition,\n<em>all</em> sane perception, and <em>all</em> knowledge. It perceives their threat as\ntotal, because it senses the fact that <em>all</em> commitments the mind makes\n<em>are</em> total. Forced, therefore, to detach itself from you who <em>are</em>\nmind, it is willing to attach itself to <em>anything</em> else. But there <em>is</em>\nnothing else. It does not follow that the mind cannot make illusions,\nbut it <em>does</em> follow that if it makes illusions it will believe in them,\nbecause that is <em>how</em> it made them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> The Holy Spirit undoes illusions without attacking them merely\nbecause He cannot perceive them at all. They therefore do not exist for\nHim. He resolves the <em>apparent</em> conflict which they engender by\nperceiving <em>conflict</em> as meaningless. We said before that the Holy\nSpirit perceives the conflict exactly as it is, and it <em>is</em> meaningless.\nThe Holy Spirit does not want you to <em>understand</em> conflict; He wants you\nto realize that, <em>because</em> conflict is meaningless, it cannot <em>be</em>\nunderstood. We have already said that understanding brings appreciation,\nand appreciation brings love. Nothing else <em>can</em> <em>be</em> understood,\nbecause nothing else is <em>real</em>, and therefore nothing else <em>has</em>\nmeaning.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> If you will keep in mind what the Holy Spirit offers you, you cannot\nbe vigilant for anything <em>but</em> God and His Kingdom. The only reason you\nfind this difficult is because you think there <em>is</em> something else.\nBelief does not require vigilance <em>unless</em> it is conflicted. If it is,\nthere <em>are</em> conflicting components within it which have engendered a\nstate of war, and vigilance therefore has become essential. Vigilance\nhas no place at all in peace. It is necessary against beliefs which are\n<em>not</em> true and would never have been called upon by the Holy Spirit if\nyou had <em>not</em> believed the untrue. You cannot deny that, when you\nbelieve something, you have <em>made</em> it true for <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> When you believe what God does not <em>know</em>, your thought seems to\n<em>contradict</em> His, and this makes it appear <em>as if</em> you are attacking\nHim. We have repeatedly emphasized that the ego <em>does</em> believe it can\nattack God and tries to persuade you that <em>you</em> have done this. If the\nmind <em>cannot</em> attack, the ego proceeds perfectly logically to the\nposition that you cannot <em>be</em> mind. By not seeing you as you <em>are</em>, it\ncan see <em>itself</em> as it <em>wants</em> to be. Aware of its weakness, the ego\nwants your allegiance, but not as you really are. The ego therefore\nwants to engage your mind in its <em>own</em> delusional system, because\notherwise the light of <em>your</em> understanding would dispel it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> The ego wants no part of truth, because the truth is that the <em>ego</em>\nis not true. <em>If</em> truth is total, the untrue <em>cannot</em> exist. Commitment\nto either must be <em>total</em>, since they cannot coexist in your minds\n<em>without</em> splitting them. If they cannot coexist in peace and if you\n<em>want</em> peace, you must give up the idea of conflict <em>entirely</em> and for\n<em>all</em> <em>time.</em> [This requires vigilance <em>only</em> as long as <em>you do not\nrecognize what is true</em>.] While you believe that two totally\ncontradictory thought systems <em>share</em> truth, your need for vigilance is\napparent. Your minds <em>are</em> dividing their allegiance between two\nkingdoms, and you are totally committed to neither.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> Your identification with the Kingdom is totally beyond question,\nexcept by you when you are thinking insanely. What you are is not\nestablished by your perception and is not influenced <em>by</em> it at all. All\nperceived problems in identification at any level are <em>not</em> problems of\nfact. They are problems of <em>understanding</em>, since they <em>mean</em> that you\nbelieve what you can understand <em>is</em> up to you to decide. The ego\nbelieves this totally, being <em>fully</em> committed to it. It is not true.\nThe ego therefore is totally committed to untruth, perceiving in total\ncontradiction to the Holy Spirit and to the knowledge of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> You can be perceived with meaning <em>only</em> by the Holy Spirit, because\nyour being <em>is</em> the knowledge of God. Any belief that you accept which\nis apart from this will obscure God’s Voice in you and will therefore\nobscure God <em>to</em> you. Unless you perceive His creation truly, you cannot\nknow the Creator, since God and His creation are not separate. The\nOneness of the Creator and the creation is your wholeness, your sanity,\nand your limitless power. This limitless power is God’s gift to you,\nbecause it is what you <em>are.</em> If you dissociate your mind from it, you\nare perceiving the most powerful force in the universe [of thought] as\nif it were weak, because you do not believe <em>you</em> are part of it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> Perceived <em>without</em> your part in it, God’s creation <em>is</em> perceived as\nweak, and those who see themselves as weakened <em>do</em> attack. The attack\nmust be blind, however, because there is nothing <em>to</em> attack. Therefore,\nthey make up images, perceive them as unworthy, and attack them for\ntheir unworthiness. That is all the world of the ego is—<em>nothing</em>. It\nhas no meaning. It does not exist. Do not try to understand it, because\nif you do, you are believing that it can <em>be</em> understood and is\ntherefore capable of being appreciated and loved. That would justify it,\nand it cannot <em>be</em> justified. You cannot make the meaningless\nmeaningful. This can <em>only</em> be an insane attempt.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> Allowing insanity to enter your minds means that you have not judged\nsanity as <em>wholly desirable.</em> If you <em>want</em> something else, you will\n<em>make</em> something else, but because it <em>is</em> something else, it will\nattack your thought system and divide your allegiance. You cannot create\nin this divided state, and you must be vigilant <em>against</em> this divided\nstate, because only peace can <em>be</em> extended. Your divided minds are\nblocking the extension of the Kingdom, and its extension <em>is</em> your joy.\nIf you do not extend the Kingdom, you are not thinking with your Creator\nand creating as He created.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> In this depressing state, the Holy Spirit reminds you gently that you\nare sad because you are not fulfilling your function as co-creators with\nGod and are therefore depriving yourselves of joy. This is not God’s\nWill but <em>yours</em>. If your will is out of accord with God’s, you are\nwilling without meaning. Yet because God’s Will is unchangeable, no\n<em>real</em> conflict of will is possible. This is the Holy Spirit’s perfectly\nconsistent teaching.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> Creation, <em>not</em> separation, is your will <em>because</em> it is God’s, and\nnothing that opposes this means anything at all. Being a perfect\naccomplishment, the Sonship can only accomplish perfectly, extending the\njoy in which it was created and identifying itself with both its Creator\nand its creations, <em>knowing</em> they are one.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>70</sup> Whenever you deny a blessing to a brother, <em>you</em> will feel deprived.\nThis is because denial is as total as love. It is as impossible to deny\npart of the Sonship as it is to love it in part. Nor is it possible to\nlove it totally <em>at times</em>. You cannot be <em>totally</em> committed\n<em>sometimes</em>. Remember a very early lesson—“Never underestimate the power\nof denial.” It has no power in itself, but you can give it the power of\n<em>your</em> mind, whose power is without limit of any kind. If you use it to\ndeny reality, reality <em>is</em> gone for you. <em>Reality cannot be partly\nappreciated</em>. That is why denying any part of it means you have lost\nawareness of <em>all</em> of it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> That is the negative side of the law as it operates in this world.\nYet denial is a defense, and so it is as capable of being used\npositively as it is of being used destructively. Used negatively it\n<em>will</em> be destructive because it will be used for attack, but in the\nservice of the Holy Spirit, [the law becomes as beneficent as all of\nthe laws of God. Stated positively,] the law requires you to recognize\nonly <em>part</em> of reality to appreciate <em>all</em> of it. Mind is too powerful\nto be subject to exclusion. You will <em>never</em> be able to exclude yourself\nfrom what you project.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> When a brother acts insanely, he is offering you an opportunity to\nbless him. His need is <em>yours</em>. You <em>need</em> the blessing you can offer\nhim. There is no way for you to have it <em>except</em> by giving it. This is\nthe law of God, and it has <em>no</em> exceptions. What you deny you <em>lack</em>,\nnot because it <em>is</em> lacking, but because you have denied it in another\nand are therefore not aware of it in <em>you</em>. Every response you make is\ndetermined by what you <em>think</em> you are, and what you <em>want</em> to be <em>is</em>\nwhat you think you are. Therefore, what you want to be determines every\nresponse you make.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> You do not need God’s blessing since that you have forever, but you\n<em>do</em> need <em>yours.</em> The picture you see of yourselves is deprived,\nunloving, and very vulnerable. You <em>cannot</em> love this. Yet you can very\neasily escape from it or, better, leave it behind. You are not <em>there</em>,\nand that is not <em>you</em>. Do not see this picture in anyone, or you have\naccepted it <em>as</em> you. <em>All</em> illusions about the Sonship are dispelled\ntogether, as they were <em>made</em> together. Teach no one that he is what\n<em>you</em> would <em>not</em> want to be. Your brother is the mirror in which you\nwill see the image of yourself as long as perception lasts. And\nperception <em>will</em> last until the Sonship knows itself as whole.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> You made perception, and it must last as long as you <em>want</em> it.\nIllusions are investments. They will last as long as you value them.\nValues are relative, but they are powerful because they are mental\njudgments. The only way to dispel illusions is to withdraw <em>all</em>\ninvestment from them, and they will have no life for you, because you\nhave put them <em>out of your mind</em>. While you include them <em>in</em> it, you\nare <em>giving</em> life to them, except there is nothing there to receive your\ngift.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> The gift of life <em>is</em> yours to give because it was given <em>you.</em> You\nare unaware of your gift, <em>because</em> you do not give it. You cannot make\nnothing live since it cannot <em>be</em> enlivened. Therefore, you are not\nextending the gift you both <em>have</em> and <em>are</em>, and so you do not know\nyour being. <em>All</em> confusion comes from not extending life, since that is\n<em>not</em> the Will of your Creator. You can do nothing apart from Him, and\nyou <em>do</em> do nothing apart from Him. Keep His way to remember yourselves\nand teach His way, lest you forget yourselves. Give only honor to the\nSons of the living God and count yourselves among them gladly.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> <em>Only</em> honor is a fitting gift for those whom God Himself created\nworthy of honor and whom He honors. Give them the appreciation which God\naccords them always, because they are His beloved Sons in whom He is\nwell pleased. You cannot <em>be</em> apart from them, because you are not apart\nfrom Him. Rest in His love and protect your rest by loving. But love\n<em>everything</em> He created of which you are a part, or you cannot learn of\nHis peace and accept His gift for <em>yourself</em> and <em>as</em> yourself. You\ncannot know your own perfection until you have honored all those who\nwere created <em>like</em> you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> One Child of God is the <em>only</em> teacher sufficiently worthy to teach\nanother. One Teacher is in all your minds, and He teaches the same\nlesson to all. He always teaches you the inestimable worth of <em>every</em>\nSon of God, teaching it with infinite patience born of the [love of Him\nfor whom] He speaks. Every attack is a call for His patience, since\n<em>only</em> His patience can translate attack into blessing. Those who attack\ndo not <em>know</em> they are blessed. They attack because they believe they\nare <em>deprived</em>. Give therefore of <em>your</em> abundance and teach your\nbrothers <em>theirs</em>. Do not share their delusions of scarcity, or you will\nperceive <em>yourself</em> as lacking.</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> Attack could never promote attack unless you perceived it as a means\nof depriving you of something you <em>want</em>. Yet you cannot <em>lose</em> anything\nunless <em>you</em> did not value it and therefore did not <em>want</em> it. This\nmakes you feel <em>deprived</em> of it, and by projecting your own rejection,\nyou believe that others are taking it <em>from</em> you. One <em>must</em> be fearful\nif he believes that his brother is attacking him to tear the Kingdom of\nHeaven from him. This is the ultimate basis for <em>all</em> of the ego’s\nprojection.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> Being the part of your mind which does not believe it is responsible\nfor <em>itself</em> and being without allegiance to God, the ego is incapable\nof trust. Projecting its insane belief that <em>you</em> have been treacherous\nto <em>your</em> Creator, it believes that your brothers, who are as incapable\nof this as <em>you</em> are, are out to take God <em>from</em> you. Whenever a brother\nattacks another, this <em>is</em> what he believes. Projection <em>always</em> sees\nyour will in others. If you will to separate yourself from God, that\n<em>is</em> what you will think others are doing <em>to</em> you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> You <em>are</em> the Will of God. Do not accept anything else <em>as</em> your\nwill, or you are denying what you are. Deny this and you <em>will</em> attack,\nbelieving you have <em>been</em> attacked. But see the love of God in you, and\nyou will see it everywhere, because it <em>is</em> everywhere. See His\nabundance in everyone, and you will know that you are in Him <em>with</em>\nthem. They are part of you, as you are part of God. <em>You</em> are as lonely\nwithout understanding this as God Himself is lonely when His Sons do not\nknow Him. The peace of God <em>is</em> understanding this. There is only one\nway <em>out</em> of the world’s thinking, just as there was only one way <em>into</em>\nit. Understand totally by understanding <em>totality</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> Perceive <em>any</em> part of the ego’s thought system as wholly insane,\nwholly delusional, and wholly undesirable, and you have correctly\nevaluated <em>all</em> of it. This correction enables you to perceive <em>any</em>\npart of creation as wholly real, wholly perfect, and <em>wholly desirable.</em>\nWanting this <em>only</em>, you will <em>have</em> this only, and giving this only,\nyou will <em>be</em> only this. The gifts you offer to the ego are <em>always</em>\nexperienced as sacrifices, but the gifts you offer to the Kingdom are\ngifts to <em>you.</em> They will always be treasured by God, because they\nbelong to His beloved Sons who belong to Him. All power and glory are\nyours, <em>because</em> the Kingdom is His.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>82</sup> We once said that without projection there can be no anger, but it is\nalso true that without projection there can be no love. Projection is a\nfundamental law of the mind and therefore one which <em>always</em> operates.\nIt is the law by which you create and were created. It is the law which\nunifies the Kingdom and keeps it in the Mind of God. To the ego, the law\nis perceived as a way of getting <em>rid</em> of something it does <em>not</em> want.\nTo the Holy Spirit, it is the fundamental law of sharing by which you\n<em>give</em> what you value in order to keep it in your <em>own</em> mind.</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> Projection, to the Holy Spirit, is the law of extension. To the ego,\nit is the law of deprivation. It therefore produces abundance or\nscarcity, depending on how you choose to apply it. This choice <em>is</em> up\nto you, but it is <em>not</em> up to you to decide whether or not you will\n<em>utilize</em> projection. Every mind <em>must</em> project, because that is how it\nlives, and every mind <em>is</em> life. The ego’s use of projection must be\nfully understood before its inevitable association between projection\nand anger can be finally undone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>84</sup> The ego <em>always</em> tries to preserve conflict. It is very ingenious in\ndevising ways which <em>seem</em> to diminish conflict, because it does <em>not</em>\nwant you to find conflict so intolerable that you will <em>insist</em> on\ngiving it up. Therefore, the ego tries to persuade you that <em>it</em> can\nfree you of conflict, lest you give the <em>ego</em> up and free <em>yourself</em>.\nThe ego, using its own warped version of the laws of God, utilizes the\npower of the mind <em>only</em> to defeat the mind’s real purpose. It projects\nconflict <em>from</em> your mind to <em>other</em> minds in an attempt to persuade you\nthat you have gotten <em>rid</em> of it. This has several fallacies which may\nnot be so apparent.</p>\n\n<p><sup>85</sup> Strictly speaking, conflict cannot <em>be</em> projected, precisely\n<em>because</em> it cannot be fully shared. Any attempt to keep <em>part</em> of it\nand get rid of another part does not really mean <em>anything.</em> Remember\nthat a conflicted teacher is a poor teacher <em>and a poor learner.</em> His\nlessons are confused, and their transfer value is severely limited <em>by</em>\nhis confusion. A second fallacy is the idea that you can get <em>rid</em> of\nsomething you do not want by giving it away. <em>Giving</em> it is how you\n<em>keep</em> it. The belief that by giving it <em>out</em> you have excluded it from\n<em>within</em> is a complete distortion of the power of extension.</p>\n\n<p><sup>86</sup> That is why those who project from the ego are vigilant for their\n<em>own</em> safety. They <em>are</em> afraid that their projections will return and\nhurt them. They <em>do</em> believe they have blotted their projections from\ntheir <em>own</em> minds, but they also believe their projections are trying to\ncreep back <em>into</em> them. That is because the projections have <em>not</em> left\ntheir minds, and this in turn forces them to engage in compulsive\nactivity in order <em>not</em> to recognize this. You <em>cannot</em> perpetuate an\nillusion about another <em>without</em> perpetuating it about yourself. There\nis no way out of this, because it is <em>impossible</em> to fragment the mind.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> To fragment is to break into pieces, and mind <em>cannot</em> attack or <em>be</em>\nattacked. The belief that it <em>can</em>, a fallacy which the ego <em>always</em>\nmakes, underlies its whole use of projection. It does not understand\nwhat mind <em>is</em> and therefore does not understand what <em>you</em> are. Yet its\nexistence is dependent on your mind, because the ego <em>is</em> your belief.\nThe ego is therefore a confusion in identification which never had a\nconsistent model and never developed consistently. It is the distorted\nproduct of the misapplication of the laws of God by distorted minds\nwhich are misusing their own power.</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> <em>Do not be afraid of the ego</em>. It <em>does</em> depend on your mind and, as\nyou made it by believing in it, so you can dispel it by withdrawing\nbelief <em>from</em> it. Do not project the responsibility for your belief in\nit onto anyone <em>else</em>, or you will <em>preserve</em> the belief. When you are\nwilling to accept sole responsibility for the ego’s existence\n<em>yourself</em>, you will have laid aside all anger and all attack, because\nthey <em>come</em> from an attempt to project responsibility for your <em>own</em>\nerrors. But having <em>accepted</em> the errors as yours, <em>do not keep them</em>.\nGive them over quickly to the Holy Spirit to be undone completely so\nthat <em>all</em> their effects will vanish from your minds and from the\nSonship <em>as a whole</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>89</sup> The Holy Spirit will teach you to perceive <em>beyond</em> belief, because\ntruth <em>is</em> beyond belief, and His perception <em>is</em> true. The ego can be\ncompletely forgotten at <em>any</em> time, because it was always a belief that\nis totally incredible. No one can <em>keep</em> a belief he has judged to be\nunbelievable. The more you learn about the ego, the more you realize\nthat it cannot <em>be</em> believed. The incredible cannot be understood,\nbecause it <em>is</em> unbelievable. The utter meaninglessness of all\nperception that comes from the unbelievable must be apparent, but it is\nnot <em>recognized</em> as beyond belief, because it was made <em>by</em> belief.</p>\n\n<p><sup>90</sup> The whole purpose of this course is to teach you that the ego is\nunbelievable and will forever <em>be</em> unbelievable. You who made the ego by\nbelieving the unbelievable cannot make this judgment alone. By accepting\nthe Atonement for <em>yourself</em>, you are deciding against the belief that\nyou can <em>be</em> alone, thus dispelling the idea of separation and affirming\nyour true identification with the whole Kingdom as literally <em>part</em> of\nyou. This identification is as beyond doubt as it is beyond belief. Your\nwholeness has no limits, because being is in infinity.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>91</sup> Only <em>you</em> can limit your creative power, but God wills to release\nit. He no more wills you to deprive yourself of your creations than He\nwills to deprive Himself of His. Do not withhold your gifts to the\nSonship, or you withhold yourself from God. Selfishness is of the ego,\nbut self-fullness is of the Soul, because that is how God created it.\nThe Holy Spirit is the part of the mind that lies between the ego and\nthe Soul, mediating between them <em>always</em> in favor of the Soul. To the\nego, this is partiality, and it therefore responds as if it were the\npart that is being sided <em>against</em>. To the Soul, this is truth, because\nit knows its fullness and cannot conceive of any part from which it is\nexcluded.</p>\n\n<p><sup>92</sup> The Soul <em>knows</em> that the consciousness of all its brothers is\nincluded in its own, as <em>it</em> is included in God. The power of the whole\nSonship <em>and</em> of its Creator is therefore the Soul’s own fullness,\nrendering its creations equally whole and equal in perfection. The ego\ncannot prevail against a totality which includes God, and any totality\n<em>must</em> include God. Everything He created is given all His power,\nbecause it is part of Him and shares His Being with Him. Creating is the\nopposite of loss, as blessing is the opposite of sacrifice. Being <em>must</em>\nbe extended. That is how it retains the knowledge of <em>itself.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>93</sup> The Soul yearns to share its being as <em>its</em> Creator did. Created <em>by</em>\nsharing, its will is to create. It does not wish to <em>contain</em> God but to\n<em>extend</em> His Being. The extension of God’s Being is the Soul’s <em>only</em>\nfunction. Its fullness cannot be contained any more than can the\nfullness of its Creator. Fullness <em>is</em> extension. The ego’s whole\nthought system blocks extension and thus blocks your only function. It\ntherefore blocks your joy, and that is why you perceive yourselves as\nunfulfilled. Unless you create, you <em>are</em> unfulfilled; but God does not\nknow of unfulfillment, and therefore you <em>must</em> create. <em>You</em> may not\nknow your own creations, but this can no more interfere with their\nreality than your unawareness of your Soul can interfere with its being.</p>\n\n<p><sup>94</sup> The Kingdom is forever extending, because it is in the Mind of God.\nYou do not <em>know</em> your joy, because you do not know your own\nself-fullness. Exclude <em>any</em> part of the Kingdom from yourself, and you\nare <em>not</em> whole. A split mind cannot perceive its fullness and needs the\nmiracle of its wholeness to dawn upon it and heal it. This reawakens the\nwholeness in it and restores it to the Kingdom because of its\n<em>acceptance</em> of wholeness. The full appreciation of its self-fullness\nmakes selfishness impossible and extension inevitable. That is why there\nis perfect peace in the Kingdom. Every Soul <em>is</em> fulfilling its\nfunction, and only complete fulfillment <em>is</em> peace.</p>\n\n<p><sup>95</sup> Insanity <em>appears</em> to add to reality, but no one would claim that\nwhat it adds is true. Insanity is therefore the <em>non</em>-extension of\ntruth, which blocks joy because it blocks creation and thus blocks\nself-fulfillment. The unfulfilled <em>must</em> be depressed, because their\nself-fullness is unknown to them. Your creations are protected <em>for</em>\nyou, because the Holy Spirit, Who is in your mind, knows of them and can\nbring them <em>into</em> your awareness whenever you will let Him. They are\nthere as part of your own being, because your fulfillment <em>includes</em>\nthem. The creations of every Son of God are yours since every creation\nbelongs to everyone, being created for the Sonship as a whole.</p>\n\n<p><sup>96</sup> You have <em>not</em> failed to add to the inheritance of the Sons of God\nand thus have not failed to secure it for yourselves. If it was the Will\nof God to give it to you, He gave it forever. If it was His Will that\nyou have it forever, He gave you the means for keeping it, <em>and you have\ndone so</em>. Disobeying God’s Will is meaningful only to the insane. In\ntruth it is impossible. Your self-fullness is as boundless as God’s.\nLike His, it extends forever and in perfect peace. Its radiance is so\nintense that it creates in perfect joy, and only the whole can be born\nof its wholeness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>97</sup> Be confident that you have never lost your identity and the\nextensions which maintain it in wholeness and peace. Miracles are an\n<em>expression</em> of this confidence. They are reflections both of your own\nproper identification with your brothers and of your own awareness that\nyour identification <em>is</em> maintained by extension. The miracle is a\n<em>lesson in total perception</em>. By including <em>any</em> part of totality in the\nlesson, you <em>have</em> included the whole. You have said that when you write\nof the Kingdom and your creations which belong in it, you are describing\n<em>what you do not know.</em> That is true in a sense, but no more true than\nyour failure to acknowledge the whole result of the ego’s premises. The\nKingdom is the result of premises, just as this world is.</p>\n\n<p><sup>98</sup> You <em>have</em> carried the ego’s reasoning to its logical conclusion,\nwhich is <em>total confusion about everything</em>. Yet you do not really\n<em>believe</em> this, or you could not possibly maintain it. If you really saw\nthis result, you could not <em>want</em> it. The only reason why you could\npossibly want <em>any</em> part of it is because you do <em>not</em> see the whole of\nit. You [therefore] are willing to look at the ego’s premises but\n<em>not</em> at their logical outcome. Is it not possible that you have done\nthe same thing with the premises of God?</p>\n\n<p><sup>99</sup> Your creations <em>are</em> the logical outcome of His premises. <em>His</em>\nthinking has established them <em>for</em> you. They are therefore there,\n<em>exactly</em> where they belong. They belong in your mind as part of your\nidentification with His, but your state of mind and your recognition of\nwhat is <em>in</em> your mind depend at any given moment on what you believe\n<em>about</em> your mind. Whatever these beliefs may be, they are the premises\nwhich will determine what you accept <em>into</em> your mind. It is surely\nclear that you can both accept into your mind what is not really there\nand deny what <em>is</em>. Neither of these possibilities requires further\nelaboration here, but both are clearly indefensible, even if you elect\nto defend them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>100</sup> Yet the function which God Himself gave your minds through His you\nmay deny, but you cannot prevent. It is the logical outcome of what you\n<em>are</em>. The ability to see a logical outcome depends on the <em>willingness</em>\nto see it, but its truth has nothing to do with your willingness at all.\nTruth is <em>God’s</em> Will. <em>Share</em> His Will, and you share what He knows.\n<em>Deny</em> His Will as yours, and you are denying His Kingdom <em>and</em> yours.\nThe Holy Spirit will direct you only so as to avoid pain. The undoing of\npain must obviously avoid pain. Surely no one would object to this goal\n<em>if he recognized it</em>. The problem is not whether what the Holy Spirit\nsays is true, but whether you want to <em>listen</em> to what He says.</p>\n\n",

What is joyful to you <em>is</em> painful to the ego and, as long as\nyou are in doubt about what <em>you</em> are, you will be confused about joy\nand pain. This confusion is the cause of the whole idea of sacrifice.\nObey the Holy Spirit, and you <em>will</em> be giving up the ego. But you will\nbe sacrificing <em>nothing</em>. On the contrary, you will be gaining\n<em>everything.</em> If you believed this, there would <em>be</em> no conflict.</p>\n\n<p><sup>102</sup> That is why you need to <em>demonstrate</em> the obvious to yourself. It is\n<em>not</em> obvious to you. You believe that doing the <em>opposite</em> of God’s\nWill can be better for you. You also believe that it is possible to <em>do</em>\nthe opposite of God’s Will. Therefore, you believe that an impossible\nchoice is open to you and one which is both very fearful <em>and</em> very\ndesirable. Yet God <em>wills.</em> He does <em>not</em> wish. <em>Your</em> will is as\npowerful as His because it <em>is</em> His. The ego’s wishes do not mean\nanything, because the ego wishes for the impossible. You can <em>wish</em> for\nthe impossible, but you can <em>will</em> only with God. This is the ego’s\nweakness and <em>your</em> strength.</p>\n\n<p><sup>103</sup> The Holy Spirit <em>always</em> sides with you and with your strength. As\nlong as you avoid His guidance in any way, you <em>want</em> to be weak. Yet\nweakness <em>is</em> frightening. What else, then, can this decision mean\nexcept that you <em>want</em> to be fearful? The Holy Spirit <em>never</em> asks for\nsacrifice, but the ego <em>always</em> does. When you are confused about this\n<em>very</em> clear distinction in motivation, it can <em>only</em> be due to\nprojection. Projection of this kind <em>is</em> a confusion in motivation and,\n<em>given</em> this confusion, trust becomes impossible.</p>\n\n<p><sup>104</sup> No one obeys gladly a guide he does not trust, but this does not\nmean that the <em>guide</em> is untrustworthy. In this case, it <em>always</em> means\nthat the <em>follower</em> is. However, this too is merely a matter of his own\nbelief. Believing that <em>he</em> can betray, he believes that everything can\nbetray <em>him</em>. Yet this is only because he has <em>elected to follow false\nguidance</em>. Unable to follow this guidance <em>without</em> fear, he associates\nfear <em>with</em> guidance and refuses to follow <em>any</em> guidance at all. [If\nthe result of this decision is confusion, this is hardly surprising.]\nThe Holy Spirit is perfectly trustworthy, as <em>you</em> are. God Himself\ntrusts you, and therefore your trustworthiness <em>is</em> beyond question. It\nwill always remain beyond question, however much <em>you</em> may question it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>105</sup> We said before that you <em>are</em> the Will of God. His Will is not an\nidle wish, and your identification <em>with</em> His Will is not optional,\nsince it <em>is</em> what you are. Sharing His Will with me is not really open\nto choice, though it may seem to be. The whole separation lies in this\nfallacy. The only way <em>out</em> of the fallacy is to decide that you do not\nhave to decide <em>anything</em>. Everything has been given you by God’s\ndecision. That <em>is</em> His Will, and you can <em>not</em> undo it. Even the\nrelinquishment of your false decision-making prerogative, which the ego\nguards so jealously, is not accomplished by your wish. It was\naccomplished <em>for</em> you by the Will of God, Who has not left you\ncomfortless. His Voice <em>will</em> teach you how to distinguish between pain\nand joy and <em>will</em> lead you out of the confusion which you have made.\nThere <em>is</em> no confusion in the mind of a Son of God whose will <em>must</em> be\nthe Will of the Father, because the Father’s Will <em>is</em> His Son.</p>\n\n<p><sup>106</sup> Miracles are <em>in accord</em> with the Will of God Whose Will you do not\nknow, because you are confused about what <em>you</em> will. This means that\nyou are confused about what you are. If you <em>are</em> God’s Will and do not\n<em>accept</em> His Will[, you can <em>only</em> be not accepting what you are. But\nif your joy <em>is</em> what you are], you are denying joy. The miracle is\ntherefore a lesson in <em>what joy is.</em> Being a lesson in sharing, it is a\nlesson in love, which <em>is</em> joy. Every miracle is thus a lesson in truth,\nand by offering truth you are learning the difference between pain and\njoy.</p>\n\n",

There is no point in\ntrying. A Son of God is happy <em>only</em> when he knows he is with God.

Does it teach him that\nthis giving <em>is</em> his joy and that God Himself thanks him for his giving?\nThat is the <em>only</em> environment in which you can be happy. You cannot\nmake it any more than you can make yourselves. It has been created <em>for</em>\nyou, as you were created for it. God watches over His Children and\ndenies them nothing.

There are no exceptions to this lesson, because the lack of\nexceptions <em>is</em> the lesson. Every Son who returns to the Kingdom with\nthis lesson in his heart has healed the Sonship and given thanks to God.\nEveryone who learns this lesson has become the perfect teacher, because\nhe has learned it of the Holy Spirit, Who wants to teach him everything\nHe knows.

Its own\nradiance shines all around it and extends out into the darkness of other\nminds, transforming them into majesty.</p>\n\n<p><sup>111</sup> The Majesty of God is there for you to recognize and appreciate and\n<em>know.</em> Perceiving the Majesty of God <em>as</em> your brother is to accept\nyour <em>own</em> inheritance. God gives only equally. If you recognize His\ngift in anyone else, you have acknowledged what He has given <em>you</em>.\nNothing is as easy to perceive as truth. This is the perception which is\nimmediate, clear, and natural. You have trained yourselves <em>not</em> to see\nit, and this has been very difficult for you. <em>Out</em> of your natural\nenvironment, you may well ask, “What is truth?” since truth <em>is</em> the\nenvironment by which and for which you were created.</p>\n\n<p><sup>112</sup> You do not know yourselves, because you do not know <em>your</em> Creator.\nYou do not know your creations, because you do not know your brothers,\nwho created them <em>with</em> you. We said before that only the whole Sonship\nis worthy to be co-creator with God, because only the whole Sonship can\ncreate <em>like</em> Him. Whenever you heal a brother by recognizing his worth,\nyou are acknowledging <em>his</em> power to create <em>and yours.</em> He cannot have\nlost what <em>you</em> recognize, and <em>you</em> must have the glory you see in him.\nHe is a co-creator with God with <em>you</em>.

The ego has never given you a sensible answer to <em>anything</em>.\nSimply on the grounds of your own experience with the ego’s teaching,\nshould not this alone disqualify it as your future teacher? Yet the ego\nhas done more harm to your learning than this alone. Learning is joyful\nif it leads you along your natural path and facilitates the development\nof what you <em>have</em>. When you are taught <em>against</em> your nature, however,\nyou will <em>lose</em> by your learning because your learning will imprison\nyou. Your will is <em>in</em> your nature and therefore <em>cannot</em> go against it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> The ego cannot teach you anything as long as your will is free,\nbecause you will not <em>listen</em> to it. It is <em>not</em> your will to be\nimprisoned, <em>because</em> your will is free. That is why the ego is the\n<em>denial</em> of free will. It is <em>never</em> God who coerces you because He\n<em>shares</em> His Will with you. His Voice teaches <em>only</em> His Will, but that\nis not the Holy Spirit’s lesson because that is what you <em>are</em>. The\n<em>lesson</em> is that your will and God’s cannot be out of accord, <em>because</em>\nthey are one. This is the undoing of <em>everything</em> the ego tries to\nteach. It is not, then, only the direction of the curriculum which must\nbe unconflicted, but also the <em>content</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> The ego wants to teach you that you want to <em>oppose</em> God’s Will. This\nunnatural lesson cannot <em>be</em> learned, but the <em>attempt</em> to learn it is a\nviolation of your own freedom and makes you afraid of your will\n<em>because</em> it is free. The Holy Spirit opposes <em>any</em> imprisoning of the\nwill of a Son of God, <em>knowing</em> that the will of the Son <em>is</em> the\nFather’s. The Holy Spirit leads you steadily along the path of freedom,\nteaching you how to disregard or look beyond <em>everything</em> that would\nhold you back.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> We said before that the Holy Spirit teaches you the difference\nbetween pain and joy. That is the same as saying that He teaches you the\ndifference between imprisonment and freedom. <em>You</em> cannot make this\ndistinction <em>without</em> Him. That is because you have taught yourself that\nimprisonment <em>is</em> freedom. Believing them to be the same, how <em>can</em> you\ntell them apart? Can you ask the part of your mind that taught you to\nbelieve they <em>are</em> the same to teach you the <em>difference</em> between them?</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> The Holy Spirit’s teaching takes only <em>one</em> direction and has only\n<em>one</em> goal. His direction is freedom, and His goal is God. Yet He cannot\nconceive of God without <em>you</em>, because it is not God’s Will to <em>be</em>\nwithout you. When you have learned that your will <em>is</em> God’s, you could\nno more will to be without Him than He could will to be without <em>you</em>.\nThis <em>is</em> freedom and this <em>is</em> joy. Deny yourself this and you <em>are</em>\ndenying God His Kingdom because He created you <em>for</em> this. When we said,\n“All power and glory are yours because the Kingdom is His,” this is what\nwe meant.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> The Will of God is without limit, and all power and glory lie within\nit. It is boundless in strength and in love and in peace. It has no\nboundaries because its extension is unlimited, and it encompasses all\nthings because it created all things. By creating all things, it made\nthem part of itself. <em>You</em> are the Will of God, because this is how you\nwere created. Because your Creator creates <em>only</em> like Himself, you\n<em>are</em> like Him. You are part of Him Who <em>is</em> all power and glory and are\ntherefore as unlimited as He is.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> To what else <em>except</em> all power and glory can the Holy Spirit appeal\nto restore God’s Kingdom? His appeal, then, is merely to what the\nKingdom <em>is</em> and for its own acknowledgment of what it is. When you\nacknowledge this, you bring the acknowledgment automatically to\neveryone, because you <em>have</em> acknowledged everyone. By <em>your</em>\nrecognition you awaken <em>theirs</em>, and through theirs <em>yours</em> is extended.\nAwakening runs easily and gladly through the Kingdom in answer to the\ncall of God. This is the natural response of every Son of God to the\nVoice of his Creator, because it is the Voice for <em>his</em> creations and\nfor his own extension.</p>\n\n",

The ego does not\nknow this, because it does not know anything. But <em>you</em> can know this,\nand you <em>will</em> know it if you are willing to look at what the ego has\nmade of <em>you</em>. This <em>is</em> your responsibility, because once you have\nreally done this, you <em>will</em> accept the Atonement for yourself. What\nother choice could you make? Having made this choice, you will begin to\nlearn and understand why you have believed that when you met someone\nelse, you had thought that he <em>was</em> someone else. And every holy\nencounter in which <em>you</em> enter fully will teach you <em>this is not so.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> You can encounter <em>only</em> part of yourself, because you are part of\nGod, Who <em>is</em> everything. His power and glory are everywhere, and you\n<em>cannot</em> be excluded from them. The ego teaches that your strength is in\nyou <em>alone</em>.

Dispelling it is salvation,\nand in this sense I <em>am</em> the salvation of the world.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> The world must despise and reject me, because the world <em>is</em> the\nbelief that love is impossible. <em>Your</em> reactions to me are the reactions\nof the world to God. If you will accept the fact that I am with you, you\nare <em>denying</em> the world and <em>accepting</em> God. My will is His, and <em>your</em>\nwill to hear me is the decision to hear His Voice and abide in His Will.\nAs God sent me to you, so will I send you to others, and I will go to\nthem <em>with</em> you so we can teach them [union and peace].</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> Do you not think the world <em>needs</em> peace as much as you do? Do you\nnot want to <em>give</em> it to the world as much as you want to <em>receive</em> it?\nFor unless you do, you will <em>not</em> receive it. If you will to have it of\nme, you <em>must</em> give it. Rehabilitation does not come from anyone else.\nYou can have guidance from without, but you must <em>accept</em> it from\nwithin. The guidance must [become] what <em>you</em> want, or it will be\nmeaningless to you. That is why rehabilitation is a collaborative\nventure.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> I can tell you what to do, but this will not help you unless you\ncollaborate by believing that I <em>know</em> what to do. Only then will your\nmind choose to follow me. Without <em>your</em> will, you cannot <em>be</em>\nrehabilitated. <em>Motivation</em> to be healed is the crucial factor in\nrehabilitation. Without this you are deciding <em>against</em> healing, and\nyour veto of my will for you <em>makes healing impossible</em>. If healing <em>is</em>\nour joint will, unless our wills <em>are</em> joined you <em>cannot</em> be healed.\nThis is obvious when you consider what healing is <em>for</em>. Healing is the\nway in which the separation is overcome. Separation is overcome by\n<em>union</em>. It cannot be overcome by separating.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> The <em>will</em> to unite must be unequivocal, or the will <em>itself</em> is\ndivided or not whole. Your will is the means by which you determine your\nown condition, because will is the <em>mechanism</em> of decision. It is the\npower by which you separate or join and experience pain or joy\naccordingly. My will cannot <em>overcome</em> yours, because yours is as\npowerful as mine. If it were not so, the Sons of God would be unequal.\nAll things are possible through our <em>joint</em> will, but my will alone\ncannot help you. Your will is as free as mine, and God Himself would not\ngo against it. <em>I</em> cannot will what God does <em>not</em> will. I can offer you\nmy will to make <em>yours</em> invincible by this sharing, but I cannot\n<em>oppose</em> yours without competing with it and thereby violating God’s\nWill for you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> Nothing God created can oppose your will, as nothing God created can\noppose His. God <em>gave</em> your will its power, which I can only acknowledge\nin honor of <em>His</em>. If you want to be like me, I will help you, knowing\nthat we <em>are</em> alike. If you want to be different, I will wait until you\nchange your mind. I can <em>teach</em> you, but only you can choose to <em>listen</em>\nto my teaching. How else can it be, if God’s Kingdom <em>is</em> freedom?\nFreedom cannot be learned by tyranny of any kind, and the perfect\nequality of <em>all</em> God’s Sons cannot be recognized through the dominion\nof one will over another. God’s Sons are equal in will, all being the\nWill of their Father. This is the <em>only</em> lesson I came to teach, knowing\nthat it is true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> When your will is <em>not</em> mine, it is not our Father’s. This means that\nyou have imprisoned <em>yours</em> and have not <em>let</em> it be free. Of yourselves\nyou can do nothing, because of yourselves you <em>are</em> nothing. I am\nnothing without the Father, and <em>you</em> are nothing without <em>me</em>, because\nby denying the Father you deny <em>yourself</em>. I will <em>always</em> remember you,\nand in <em>my</em> remembrance of you lies your remembrance of <em>yourself.</em> In\nour remembrance of <em>each other</em> lies our remembrance of God, and in this\nremembrance lies your freedom, because your freedom <em>is</em> in Him. Join\nthen with me in praise of Him <em>and</em> you whom He created. This is our\ngift of gratitude to Him, which He will share with <em>all</em> His creations,\nto whom He gives equally whatever is acceptable to Him. <em>Because</em> it is\nacceptable to Him, it is the gift of freedom, which <em>is</em> His Will for\nall His Sons. By <em>offering</em> freedom, <em>you</em> will be free.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> Freedom is the only gift you can offer to God’s Sons, being an\nacknowledgment of what <em>they</em> are and what <em>He</em> is. Freedom is creation,\nbecause it is love. What you seek to imprison you do <em>not</em> love.\nTherefore, when you seek to imprison anyone, including <em>yourself</em>, you\ndo not love him, and you cannot identify <em>with</em> him. When you imprison\nyourself, you are losing sight of your true identification with me and\nwith the Father. Your identification <em>is</em> with the Father and with the\nSon. It <em>cannot</em> be with one and not the other. If you are part of one,\nyou must be part of the other, because they <em>are</em> one.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> The Holy Trinity is holy, <em>because</em> it is one. If you exclude\n<em>yourself</em> from this union, you are perceiving the Holy Trinity as\nseparated. You must be included <em>in</em> It, because It <em>is</em> everything.\nUnless you take your place in It and fulfill your function as <em>part</em> of\nIt, It is as bereft as <em>you</em> are. No part of It can be imprisoned if Its\ntruth is to be known. Can you be separated from your identification and\nbe at peace? Dissociation is not a solution; it is a <em>delusion</em>. The\ndelusional believe that truth will assail them, and so they do not <em>see</em>\nit, because they <em>prefer</em> the delusion. Judging truth as something they\ndo <em>not</em> want, they perceive deception and block knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> Help them by offering them <em>your</em> unified will on their behalf, as I\nam offering you mine on <em>yours</em>. Alone we can do nothing, but <em>together</em>\nour wills fuse into something whose power is far beyond the power of its\nseparate parts. By <em>not being separate</em>, the Will of God is established\n<em>in</em> ours and <em>as</em> ours. This will is invincible, <em>because</em> it is\nundivided. The undivided will of the Sonship is the perfect creator,\nbeing wholly in the likeness of God, Whose Will it <em>is.</em> <em>You</em> cannot be\nexempt from it if you are to understand what <em>it</em> is and what <em>you</em> are.\nBy separating your will <em>from</em> mine, you are exempting yourself from the\nWill of God, which <em>is</em> yourself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> Yet to heal is still to make whole. Therefore, to heal is to <em>unite</em>\nwith those who are like you, because perceiving this likeness <em>is</em> to\nrecognize the Father. If <em>your</em> perfection is in Him and <em>only</em> in Him,\nhow can you <em>know</em> it without recognizing Him? The recognition of God\n<em>is</em> the recognition of yourself. There <em>is</em> no separation of God and\nHis creation. You will learn this as you learn that there is no\nseparation of <em>your</em> will and <em>mine</em>. Let the love of God shine upon you\nby your acceptance of me. <em>My</em> reality is yours <em>and</em> His. By joining\nyour will with mine, you are signifying your awareness that the Will of\nGod is one.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> God’s Oneness and ours are not separate, because His Oneness\n<em>encompasses</em> ours. To join with me is to restore His power to you,\n<em>because</em> we are sharing it. I offer you only the <em>recognition</em> of His\npower in you, but in that lies <em>all</em> truth. As <em>we</em> unite, we unite with\nHim. Glory be to the union of God and His holy Sons! All glory lies in\nthem <em>because</em> they are united. The miracles we do bear witness to the\nWill of the Father for His Son and to our joy in uniting <em>with</em> His Will\nfor us.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> When you unite with me, you are uniting <em>without</em> the ego, because I\nhave renounced the ego in myself and therefore <em>cannot</em> unite with\nyours. <em>Our</em> union is therefore the way to renounce the ego in\n<em>yourself.</em> The truth in both of us is <em>beyond</em> the ego. By willing\nthat, you <em>have</em> gone beyond it toward truth. Our success in\ntranscending the ego is guaranteed by God, and I can share [my perfect\nconfidence in His promise, because I know He gave me] this confidence\nfor both of us and <em>all</em> of us. I bring God’s peace back to all His\nChildren, because I received it of Him for us all. Nothing can prevail\nagainst our united wills, because nothing can prevail against God’s.\nWould you know the Will of God for <em>you</em>? Ask it of me who knows it\n<em>for</em> you, and you will find it. I will deny you nothing, as God denies\n<em>me</em> nothing.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> Ours is simply the journey back to God, Who is our home. Whenever\nfear intrudes anywhere along the road to peace, it is <em>always</em> because\nthe ego has attempted to join the journey with us <em>and</em> <em>cannot do so</em>.\nSensing defeat and angered by it, the ego regards itself as rejected and\nbecomes retaliative. You are invulnerable to its retaliation, <em>because I\nam with you</em>. On this journey, you have chosen me as your companion\n<em>instead</em> of the ego. Do not try to hold on to both, or you will try to\ngo in different directions and will lose the way.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> The ego’s way is not mine, but it is also <em>not yours</em>. The Holy\nSpirit has <em>one</em> direction for <em>all</em> minds, and the one He taught me is\n<em>yours</em>. Let us not lose sight of His direction through illusions, for\nonly illusions of another direction can obscure the one for which God’s\nVoice speaks in all of us. Never accord the ego the power to interfere\nwith the journey because it <em>has</em> none, [and] the journey is the way\nto what is true. Leave <em>all</em> deception behind and reach beyond all\nattempts of the ego to hold you back. I go before you, because I <em>am</em>\nbeyond the ego. Reach therefore for my hand, because you <em>want</em> to\ntranscend the ego. My will will <em>never</em> be wanting, and if you <em>want</em> to\nshare it you <em>will</em>. I give it willingly and gladly, because I need you\nas much as you need me.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>42</sup> <em>We</em> are the joint will of the Sonship, whose wholeness is for all.\nWe begin the journey back by setting out <em>together</em> and gather in our\nbrothers as we <em>continue</em> together. Every gain in our strength is\noffered for all, so they too can lay aside their weakness and add their\nstrength to us. God’s welcome waits for us all, and He will welcome us\nas I am welcoming you. Forget not the Kingdom of God for anything the\nworld has to offer. The world can add nothing to the power and the glory\nof God and His holy Sons, but it <em>can</em> blind the Sons to the Father if\nthey behold it. You cannot behold the world and know God. Only one is\ntrue.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> I am come to tell you that the choice of which is true is not yours.\nIf it were, you would have destroyed yourselves. Yet God did not will\nthe destruction of His creations, having created them for eternity. His\nWill has saved you, not from yourselves, but from your <em>illusions</em> of\nyourselves. He has saved you <em>for</em> yourselves. Let us glorify Him whom\nthe world denies, for over His Kingdom, it has no power. No one created\nby God can find joy in anything <em>except</em> the eternal. That is not\nbecause he is deprived of anything else, but because nothing else is\n<em>worthy</em> of him. What God and His Sons create <em>is</em> eternal, and in this\nand this only is their joy.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> Listen to the story of the prodigal son, and learn what God’s\ntreasure is and <em>yours</em>: This son of a loving father left his home and\nthought he squandered everything for nothing of any value, although he\ndid not know its worthlessness at the time. He was ashamed to return to\nhis father because he thought he had hurt him. Yet when he came home,\nthe father welcomed him with joy, because only the son himself <em>was</em> his\nfather’s treasure. He <em>wanted</em> nothing else.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> God wants only His Son because His Son is His only treasure. You want\n<em>your</em> creations as He wants <em>His.</em> Your creations are your gift to the\nHoly Trinity, created in gratitude for <em>your</em> creation. They do not\nleave you, any more than you have left <em>your</em> Creator, but they <em>extend</em>\nyour creation as God extended Himself to <em>you</em>. Can the creations of God\nHimself take joy in what is not real? And what <em>is</em> real except the\ncreations of God and those which are created like His? <em>Your</em> creations\nlove you as your Soul loves your Father for the gift of creation. There\n<em>is</em> no other gift which is eternal, and therefore there is no other\ngift which is <em>true.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> How, then, can you <em>accept</em> anything else or <em>give</em> anything else and\nexpect joy in return? And what else but joy would you <em>want</em>? You made\nneither yourself nor your function. You made only the <em>decision</em> to be\nunworthy of both. Yet you could not make <em>yourself</em> unworthy, because\nyou are the treasure of God. What <em>He</em> values <em>is</em> valuable. There can\n<em>be</em> no question of its worth because its value lies in God’s sharing\nHimself with it and <em>establishing</em> its value forever.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> <em>Your</em> function is to add to God’s treasure by creating <em>yours</em>. His\nWill <em>to</em> you is His Will <em>for</em> you. He would not withhold creation from\nyou, because <em>His</em> joy is in it. You cannot find joy <em>except</em> as God\ndoes. <em>His</em> joy lay in creating <em>you</em>, and He extends His Fatherhood to\nyou so that you can extend yourself as He did. You do not understand\nthis, because you do not understand <em>Him</em>. No one who does not know his\nfunction can understand it, and no one <em>can</em> know his function unless he\nknows who he <em>is.</em> Creation is the Will of God. His Will created you to\ncreate. Your will was not created separate from His, and so it wills as\n<em>He</em> wills.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> An “unwilling will” does not mean anything, [because it is] a\ncontradiction in terms which actually leaves nothing. [You can make\nyourself powerless only in a way that has no meaning at all.] When you\n<em>think</em> you are unwilling to will with God, <em>you are not thinking</em>.\nGod’s Will <em>is</em> thought. It cannot be contradicted <em>by</em> thought. God\ndoes not contradict <em>Himself</em>, and His Sons, who are like Him, cannot\ncontradict themselves <em>or</em> Him. Yet their thought is so powerful that\nthey can even imprison the mind of God’s Son <em>if they so choose</em>. This\nchoice <em>does</em> make the Son’s function unknown to <em>him</em>, but <em>never</em> to\nhis Creator. And <em>because</em> it is not unknown to his Creator, it is\nforever knowable to him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> There is no question but one you should ever ask of yourself: “Do I\n<em>want</em> to know my Father’s Will for me?” <em>He</em> will not hide it. He has\nrevealed it to me, because I asked it of Him and learned of what He had\nalready given. Our function is to function together, because <em>apart</em>\nfrom each other we cannot function at all. The whole power of God’s Son\nlies in all of us, but not in any of us alone. God would not have us be\nalone, because <em>He</em> does not will to be alone. That is why He created\nHis Son and gave him the power to create with Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> Our creations are as holy as we are, and we are the Sons of God\nHimself and therefore as holy as He is. Through our creations, we extend\nour love and thus increase the joy of the Holy Trinity. You do not\nunderstand this for a very simple reason. You who are God’s own treasure\ndo not regard yourselves as valuable. Given this belief, you cannot\nunderstand <em>anything</em>. I share with God the knowledge of the value <em>He</em>\nputs upon you. My devotion to you is of Him, being born of my knowledge\nof myself <em>and</em> Him. We cannot <em>be</em> separated. Whom God has joined\ncannot be separated, and God has joined all His Sons with Himself. Can\nyou be separated from your life and your being?</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> The journey to God is merely the reawakening of the knowledge of\n<em>where</em> you are always and <em>what</em> you are forever. It is a journey\nwithout distance to a goal that has never changed. Truth can only be\n<em>experienced</em>. It cannot be described, and it cannot be explained. I can\nmake you aware of the <em>conditions</em> of truth, but the experience is of\nGod. Together we can meet its conditions, but truth will dawn upon you\nof itself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> What God has willed for you <em>is</em> yours. He has given His Will to His\ntreasure, whose treasure it is. Your heart lies where your treasure is,\nas His does. You who are beloved of God are wholly blessed. Learn this\nof me, and free the holy will of all those who are as blessed as <em>you</em>\nare.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>53</sup> Attack is <em>always</em> physical. When attack in any form enters your\nmind, you are <em>equating</em> yourself with a body. This is the ego’s\n<em>interpretation</em> of the body. You do not have to attack physically to\naccept this interpretation. You are accepting it simply by the belief\nthat attack can <em>get</em> you something you want. If you did not believe\nthis, the idea of attack would have no appeal for you. When you equate\nyourself with a body, you will <em>always</em> experience depression. When a\nChild of God thinks of himself in this way, he is belittling himself and\nseeing his brothers as similarly belittled. Since he can find himself\n<em>only</em> in them, he has cut himself off from salvation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> Remember that the Holy Spirit interprets the body only as a means of\ncommunication. Being the communication link between God and His\nseparated Sons, the Holy Spirit interprets everything <em>you</em> have made in\nthe light of what <em>He</em> is. The ego <em>separates</em> through the body. The\nHoly Spirit <em>reaches through</em> it to others. You do not perceive your\nbrothers as the Holy Spirit does, because you do not interpret their\nbodies and yours solely as a means of joining their <em>minds</em> and uniting\nthem with yours and mine. This interpretation of the body will change\nyour mind entirely about its value. Of itself it has <em>none</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> If you use the body for attack, it <em>is</em> harmful to you. If you use it\nonly to reach the minds of those who believe they are bodies and teach\nthem <em>through</em> the body that this is not so, you will begin to\nunderstand the power of the mind that is in both of you. If you use the\nbody for this and <em>only</em> for this, you <em>cannot</em> use it for attack. In\nthe service of uniting, it becomes a beautiful lesson in communion,\nwhich has value until communion <em>is</em>. This is God’s way of making\nunlimited what you have limited. The Holy Spirit does not see the body\nas you do, because He knows the <em>only</em> reality anything can have is the\nservice it can render God on behalf of the function He has given it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Communication <em>ends</em> separation. Attack <em>promotes</em> it. The body is\nbeautiful or ugly, holy or savage, helpful or harmful, according to the\nuse to which it is put. And in the body of another you will <em>see</em> the\nuse to which you have put yours. If the body becomes for you a means\nwhich you give to the Holy Spirit to use on behalf of union of the\nSonship, you will not see anything physical except as what it is. Use it\nfor truth, and you will see it truly. <em>Misuse</em> it, and you <em>will</em>\nmisunderstand it, because you have already done so <em>by</em> misusing it.\nInterpret <em>anything</em> apart from the Holy Spirit, and you will mistrust\nit. This will lead you to hatred and attack <em>and loss of peace</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> Yet all loss comes only from your own misunderstanding. Loss of <em>any</em>\nkind is impossible. When you look upon a brother as a physical entity,\n<em>his</em> power and glory are lost <em>to you</em>, and so are <em>yours</em>. You <em>have</em>\nattacked him, but you <em>must</em> have attacked yourself first. Do not see\nhim this way for your <em>own</em> salvation, which must bring him <em>his</em>. Do\nnot allow him to belittle himself in <em>your</em> mind, but give him freedom\nfrom his belief in littleness and thus escape from <em>yours</em>. As part of\nyou, <em>he</em> is holy. As part of me, <em>you</em> are. To communicate with part of\nGod Himself is to reach beyond the Kingdom to its Creator through His\nVoice, which He has established as part of <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> Rejoice, then, that of yourselves you can do nothing. You are not\n<em>of</em> yourselves. He of Whom you <em>are</em> has willed your power and glory\n<em>for</em> you, with which you can perfectly accomplish His holy will for you\nwhen you so will it yourself. He has not withdrawn His gifts from you,\nbut <em>you</em> have withdrawn them from Him. Let no Son of God remain hidden\nfor His Name’s sake, because His Name is <em>yours</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> Remember that the Bible says, “The Word (or thought) was made flesh.”\nStrictly speaking this is impossible, since it seems to involve the\ntranslation of one order of reality into another. Different orders of\nreality merely <em>appear</em> to exist, just as different orders of miracles\ndo. Thought cannot be made into flesh except by belief, since thought is\n<em>not</em> physical. Yet thought <em>is</em> communication, for which the body <em>can</em>\nbe used. This is the only <em>natural</em> use to which it <em>can</em> be put. To use\nthe body unnaturally is to lose sight of the Holy Spirit’s purpose and\nthus to confuse the goal of His curriculum.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> There is nothing so frustrating to a learner as to be placed in a\ncurriculum which he cannot learn. His sense of adequacy suffers, and he\n<em>must</em> become depressed. Being faced with an impossible learning\nsituation, regardless of why it is impossible, is the most depressing\nthing in the world. In fact, it is ultimately <em>why</em> the world is\ndepressing. The Holy Spirit’s curriculum is <em>never</em> depressing, because\nit is a curriculum of joy. Whenever the reaction to learning is\ndepression, it is only because the goal of the curriculum has been lost\nsight of.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> In the world, not even the body is perceived as whole. Its purpose is\nseen as fragmented into many functions which bear little or no\nrelationship to each other, so that it appears to be ruled by chaos.\nGuided by the ego, it <em>is</em>. Guided by the Holy Spirit, it is <em>not</em>. It\nbecomes only a means by which the part of the mind you have separated\nfrom your Soul can reach beyond its distortions and <em>return</em> to the\nSoul. The ego’s temple thus becomes the temple of the Holy Spirit, where\ndevotion to Him replaces devotion to the ego. In this sense, the body\n<em>does</em> become a temple to God, because His Voice abides in it by\ndirecting the use to which it is put.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> Healing is the result of using the body <em>solely</em> for communication.\nSince this is natural, it heals by making whole, which is <em>also</em>\nnatural. All mind is whole, and the belief that part of it is physical,\nor <em>not</em> mind, is a fragmented (or sick) interpretation. Mind <em>cannot</em>\nbe made physical, but it <em>can</em> be made manifest <em>through</em> the physical\nif it uses the body to go <em>beyond</em> itself. By reaching <em>out</em>, the mind\nextends itself. It does not <em>stop</em> at the body, for if it does, it is\nblocked in its purpose. A mind which has been blocked has allowed itself\nto be vulnerable to attack because it has <em>turned</em> <em>against itself.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> The removal of blocks, then, is the <em>only</em> way to guarantee help and\nhealing. Help and healing are the normal expressions of a mind which is\nworking <em>through</em> the body but not <em>in</em> it. If the mind believes the\nbody is its <em>goal</em>, it <em>will</em> distort its perception of the body and, by\nblocking its own extension beyond it, will induce illness by fostering\n<em>separation</em>. Perceiving the body as a <em>separate</em> entity cannot <em>but</em>\nfoster illness because it is not true. A medium of communication will\n<em>lose</em> its usefulness if it is used for anything else. To use a medium\nof communication as a medium of <em>attack</em> is an obvious confusion in\npurpose.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> To communicate is to join and to attack is to separate. How can you\ndo both simultaneously with the <em>same</em> <em>thing</em> and <em>not</em> suffer?\nPerception of the body can be unified only by <em>one</em> purpose. This\nreleases the mind from the temptation to see the body in many lights and\ngives it over <em>entirely</em> to the One Light in Which it can be really\nunderstood at all. To confuse a learning device with a curriculum <em>goal</em>\nis a fundamental confusion. Learning can hardly be arrested at its own\naids with hope of understanding either the aids <em>or</em> the learning’s real\npurpose. Learning must lead <em>beyond</em> the body to the reestablishment of\nthe power of the mind in it. This can be accomplished <em>only</em> if the mind\nextends to other minds and does not <em>arrest</em> itself in its extension.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> The arrest of the mind’s extension is the cause of <em>all</em> illness,\nbecause <em>only</em> extension is the mind’s function. The opposite of joy is\ndepression. When your learning promotes depression <em>instead</em> of joy, you\n<em>cannot</em> be listening to God’s joyous Teacher, and you <em>must</em> be\nlearning amiss. To see a body as anything except a means of pure\nextension <em>is</em> to limit your mind and <em>hurt yourself.</em> Health <em>is</em>\ntherefore nothing more than united purpose. If the body is brought under\nthe purpose of the mind, the body becomes whole, because the <em>mind’s</em>\npurpose <em>is</em> one. Attack can only be an <em>assumed</em> purpose of the body,\nbecause <em>apart</em> from the mind the body <em>has no purpose at all</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> You are <em>not</em> limited by the body, and thought <em>cannot</em> be made\nflesh. Yet mind can be manifested through the body if it goes beyond it\nand <em>does not interpret it as limitation</em>. Whenever you see another as\nlimited <em>to</em> or <em>by</em> the body, you are imposing this limit <em>on</em>\n<em>yourself</em>. Are you willing to <em>accept</em> this, when your whole purpose\nfor learning should be to <em>escape</em> from limitations? To conceive of the\nbody as a means of attack of any kind and to entertain even the\npossibility that joy could <em>possibly</em> result is a clear-cut indication\nof a poor learner. He has accepted a learning goal in obvious\ncontradiction to the unified purpose of the curriculum and is\ninterfering with his ability to accept its purpose as his <em>own</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> Joy is unified purpose, and unified purpose is <em>only</em> God’s. When\nyours is unified, it <em>is</em> His. Interfere with His purpose, and you\n<em>need</em> salvation. You have condemned yourself, but condemnation is <em>not</em>\nof God. Therefore, it is not true. No more are any of the <em>results</em> of\nyour condemnation. When you see a brother as a body, you are condemning\nhim <em>because</em> you have condemned yourself. Yet if all condemnation is\nunreal, and it <em>must</em> be unreal since it is a form of attack, then it\ncan <em>have</em> no results.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> Do not allow yourselves to suffer from the results of what is not\ntrue. Free your minds from the belief that this is <em>possible</em>. In its\ncomplete impossibility and your full awareness <em>of</em> its complete\nimpossibility lie your only hope for release. But what other hope would\nyou want? Freedom from illusions lies only in not <em>believing</em> them.\nThere <em>is</em> no attack, but there <em>is</em> unlimited communication and\ntherefore unlimited power and wholeness.

    "content": "<p><sup>69</sup> Attitudes toward the body are attitudes toward <em>attack</em>. The ego’s\ndefinitions of <em>everything</em> are childish and always based on what it\nbelieves a thing is <em>for</em>. This is because it is incapable of true\ngeneralizations and equates what it sees with the function <em>it</em> ascribes\nto it. It does <em>not</em> equate it with what it <em>is</em>. To the ego, the body\nis to <em>attack</em> with. Equating <em>you</em> with the body, it teaches that <em>you</em>\nare to attack with, because this is what it believes. The body, then, is\nnot the source of its own health. The body’s condition lies solely in\nyour interpretation of its function.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> The reason why definitions in terms of function are inferior is that\nthey may well be inaccurate. Functions are part of being since they\narise from it, but the relationship is not reciprocal. The whole <em>does</em>\ndefine the part, but the part does <em>not</em> define the whole. This is as\ntrue of knowledge as it is of perception. The reason to <em>know</em> in part\nis to know <em>entirely</em> is because of the fundamental <em>difference</em> between\nknowledge and perception. In perception the whole is built up of parts,\nwhich <em>can</em> separate and reassemble in different constellations.\nKnowledge never changes, so <em>its</em> constellation is permanent. The only\nareas in which part-whole relationships have <em>any</em> meaning are those in\nwhich change is possible. There <em>is</em> no difference between the whole and\nthe part where change is impossible.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> The body exists in a world which <em>seems</em> to contain two voices which\nare fighting for its possession. In this perceived constellation, the\nbody is regarded as capable of shifting its control from one to the\nother, making the concept of both health <em>and</em> sickness possible. The\nego makes a fundamental confusion between means and ends, as it always\ndoes. Regarding the body as an end, the ego has no <em>real</em> use for it\nbecause it is <em>not</em> an end. You must have noticed an outstanding\ncharacteristic of every end that the ego has accepted as its own. When\nyou have achieved it, <em>it has not satisfied you</em>. This is why the ego is\nforced to shift from one end to another without ceasing, so that <em>you</em>\nwill continue to hope that it can yet offer you something.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> It has been particularly difficult to overcome the ego’s belief in\nthe body as an end, because this is synonymous with the belief in\n<em>attack</em> as an end. The ego has a real <em>investment</em> in sickness. If you\nare sick, how can you <em>object</em> to the ego’s firm belief that you are\n<em>not</em> invulnerable? This is a particularly appealing argument from the\nego’s point of view because it obscures the obvious <em>attack</em> which\nunderlies the sickness. If you accepted <em>this</em> and also decided\n<em>against</em> attack, you could not give this false witness to the ego’s\nstand.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> It is hard to perceive sickness <em>as</em> a false witness, because you do\nnot realize that it <em>is</em> entirely out of keeping with what you want.\nThis witness, then, <em>appears</em> to be innocent and trustworthy, because\nyou have not seriously cross-examined him. If you did, you would not\nconsider sickness such a strong witness on behalf of the ego’s views.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> A more honest statement would be as follows: Those who <em>want</em> the ego\nare predisposed to defend it. Therefore, their choice of witnesses\nshould be suspect from the beginning. The ego does not call upon\nwitnesses who would disagree with its case, <em>nor does the Holy Spirit</em>.\nWe have said that judgment <em>is</em> the function of the Holy Spirit and one\nwhich He is perfectly equipped to fulfill. The ego as a judge gives\nanything <em>but</em> an impartial judgment. When the ego calls on a witness,\nit has <em>already</em> made the witness an ally.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> It is still true that the body has no function of itself, because it\nis <em>not</em> an end. The ego, however, establishes it <em>as</em> an end because as\nsuch it will lose its <em>true</em> function. This is the purpose of\n<em>everything</em> the ego does. Its sole aim is to lose sight of the function\nof <em>everything</em>. A sick body does not make any <em>sense</em>. It <em>could</em> not\nmake sense, because sickness is not what the body is <em>for</em>. Sickness is\nmeaningful only if the two basic premises on which the ego’s\ninterpretation of the body rests are true. Specifically, these are that\nthe body is for attack and that you <em>are</em> a body. Without these\npremises, sickness is completely inconceivable.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> Sickness is a way of demonstrating that <em>you can be hurt</em>. It is a\nwitness to your frailty, your vulnerability, and your extreme need to\ndepend on <em>external</em> guidance. The ego uses this as its best argument\nfor your need for <em>its</em> guidance. It dictates endless prescriptions for\n<em>avoiding</em> catastrophic outcomes. The Holy Spirit, perfectly aware of\nthe same data, does not bother to analyze them at all. If the data are\nmeaningless, there is no point in considering them. The function of\ntruth is to collect data which are <em>true</em>. There is no point in trying\nto make sense out of meaningless data. <em>Any</em> way you handle them results\nin nothing. The more complicated the results become, the harder it may\nbe to recognize their nothingness, but it is not necessary to examine\n<em>all</em> possible outcomes to which premises give rise to judge them truly.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> A learning device is <em>not</em> a teacher. <em>It</em> cannot tell you how <em>you</em>\nfeel. You do not know how you feel, because you have <em>accepted</em> the\nego’s confusion, and <em>you</em> think that a learning device <em>can</em> tell you\nhow you feel. Sickness is merely another example of your insistence on\nasking the guidance of a teacher <em>who does not know the answer</em>. The ego\nis <em>incapable</em> of knowing how you feel. When we said that the ego does\nnot know <em>anything</em>, we said the one thing about the ego that <em>is</em>\nwholly true. But there <em>is</em> a corollary; if knowledge is being and the\nego has no knowledge, then the ego has no <em>being</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> You might well ask how the voice of something which does not exist\ncan be so insistent. Have you seriously considered the distorting power\nof something you <em>want</em>, even if it is <em>not</em> true? You have had many\ninstances of how what you want can distort what you see and hear. No one\ncan doubt the ego’s skill in building up false cases. Nor can anyone\ndoubt your willingness to listen until <em>you</em> will not to tolerate\nanything <em>except</em> truth. When <em>you</em> lay the ego aside, it will be gone.\nThe Holy Spirit’s Voice is as loud as your willingness to listen. It\ncannot be louder without violating your will, which the Holy Spirit\nseeks to free but <em>never</em> to command.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> The Holy Spirit teaches you to use your body <em>only</em> to reach your\nbrothers, so He can teach His message <em>through</em> you. This will heal them\nand <em>therefore</em> heal <em>you.</em> Everything used in accordance with its\nfunction as the Holy Spirit sees it <em>cannot</em> be sick. Everything used\notherwise <em>is.</em> Do not allow the body to be a mirror of a split mind. Do\nnot let it be an image of your own perception of littleness. Do not let\nit reflect your will to attack. Health is the natural state of anything\nwhose interpretation is left to the Holy Spirit, Who perceives no attack\non anything. Health is the result of relinquishing <em>all</em> attempts to use\nthe body lovelessly. Health is the beginning of the proper perspective\non life under the guidance of the one Teacher Who knows what life is,\nbeing the Voice for Life Itself.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>80</sup> We once said that the Holy Spirit is the <em>Answer.</em> He is the Answer\nto everything, because He knows what the answer to everything <em>is</em>. The\nego does not know what a real question is, although it asks an endless\nnumber. Yet <em>you</em> can learn this as you learn to question the value of\nthe ego and thus establish your ability to evaluate its questions. When\nthe ego tempts you to sickness, do not ask the Holy Spirit to heal the\nbody, for this would merely be to accept the ego’s belief that the\n<em>body</em> is the proper aim for healing. Ask rather that the Holy Spirit\nteach you the right <em>perception</em> of the <em>body</em>, for perception alone can\nbe distorted. <em>Only</em> perception can be sick, because only perception can\nbe <em>wrong</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> Wrong perception is <em>distorted</em> <em>willing</em>, which wants things to be\nas they are not. The <em>reality</em> of everything is totally harmless,\nbecause total harmlessness is the <em>condition</em> of its reality. It is also\nthe condition of your <em>awareness</em> of its reality. You do not have to\nseek reality. It will seek <em>you</em> and find you when you meet its\nconditions. Its conditions are part of what it <em>is</em>. And this part only\nis up to you. The rest is of itself. You need do so little, because it\nis so powerful that your little part will bring the whole <em>to</em> you.\nAccept then your little part, and <em>let</em> the whole be yours.</p>\n\n<p><sup>82</sup> Wholeness heals because it is of the mind. <em>All</em> forms of sickness,\neven unto death, are physical expressions of the <em>fear of awakening</em>.\nThey are attempts to reinforce <em>unconsciousness</em> out of fear of\n<em>consciousness.</em> This is a pathetic way of trying <em>not</em> to know by\nrendering the faculties for knowing ineffectual. “Rest in peace” is a\nblessing for the living, not the dead, because rest comes from <em>waking</em>,\nnot from sleeping. Sleep is withdrawing; waking is joining. Dreams are\n<em>illusions</em> of joining, taking on the ego’s distortions about what\njoining means if you are sleeping under its guidance. Yet the Holy\nSpirit, too, has use for sleep and can use dreams on behalf of <em>waking</em>\nif you will let Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> How you wake is the sign of how you have used sleep. To whom did you\ngive it? Under which teacher did you place it? Whenever you wake\ndispiritedly, it was <em>not</em> of the Holy Spirit. <em>Only</em> when you awaken\njoyously have you utilized sleep according to the Holy Spirit’s purpose.\nYou can indeed be “drugged by sleep,” but this is always because you\nhave <em>misused</em> it on behalf of sickness. Sleep is no more a form of\ndeath than death is a form of unconsciousness. <em>Unconsciousness is\nimpossible.</em> You can rest in peace only <em>because</em> you are awake.</p>\n\n<p><sup>84</sup> Healing is release from the fear of waking and the substitution of\nthe <em>will to wake</em>. The will to wake is the will to love, since <em>all</em>\nhealing involves replacing fear with love. The Holy Spirit cannot\ndistinguish among degrees of error, for if He taught that one form of\nsickness is more serious than another, He would be teaching that one\nerror can be <em>more real</em> than another. His function is to distinguish\n<em>only</em> between the false and the true, <em>replacing</em> the false with the\ntrue.</p>\n\n<p><sup>85</sup> The ego, which always <em>weakens</em> the will, wants to <em>separate</em> the\nbody from the mind. This is an attempt to <em>destroy</em> it, yet the ego\nactually believes that it is <em>protecting</em> it. This is because the ego\nbelieves that <em>mind is dangerous</em> and that to <em>make mindless</em> is to\nheal. But to make mindless is impossible since it would mean to make\nnothing out of what God created. The ego <em>despises</em> weakness, even\nthough it makes every effort to <em>induce</em> it. The ego <em>wants</em> only what\nit hates. To the ego this is perfectly sensible. Believing in the power\nof attack, the ego <em>wants</em> attack.</p>\n\n<p><sup>86</sup> You have surely begun to realize that this is a very practical course\nwhich means <em>exactly</em> what it says. So does the Bible, if it is properly\nunderstood. There has been a marked tendency on the part of many of the\nBible’s followers and also its translators to be entirely literal about\nfear and <em>its</em> effects but <em>not</em> about love and <em>its</em> results. Thus,\n“hellfire” means “burning,” but raising the dead becomes allegorical.\nActually, it is <em>particularly</em> the references to the outcomes of love\nwhich <em>should</em> be taken literally because the Bible is <em>about</em> love,\nbeing about God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> The Bible enjoins you to be perfect, to heal <em>all</em> errors, to take no\nthought of the body <em>as separate</em>, and to accomplish all things in my\nname. This is not my name alone, for ours is a shared identification.\nThe name of God’s Son is one, and you are enjoined to do the works of\nlove, because we <em>share</em> this oneness. Our minds are whole <em>because</em>\nthey are one. If you are sick you are withdrawing from me. Yet you\ncannot withdraw from me alone. You can only withdraw from yourself <em>and</em>\nme.</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> I would not ask you to do the things you cannot do, and it is\nimpossible that I could do things you cannot do. Given this, and given\nthis <em>quite</em> <em>literally</em>, there can be nothing which prevents you from\ndoing <em>exactly</em> what I ask, and everything which argues <em>for</em> your doing\nit. I give you no limits because God lays none upon you. When you limit\n<em>yourself</em>, we are <em>not</em> of one mind and that <em>is</em> sickness. Yet\nsickness is not of the body, but of the <em>mind. All</em> forms of dysfunction\nare merely signs that the mind has split and does not accept a unified\npurpose.</p>\n\n<p><sup>89</sup> The unification of <em>purpose</em>, then, is the Holy Spirit’s <em>only</em> way\nof healing. This is because it is the only level at which healing means\nanything. The re-establishing of meaning in a chaotic thought system\n<em>is</em> the only way to heal it. We have said that your task is only to\nmeet the conditions <em>for</em> meaning since meaning itself is of God. Yet\nyour <em>return</em> to meaning is essential to <em>His</em> because your meaning is\n<em>part</em> of His. Your healing, then, is part of <em>His</em> health since it is\npart of His Wholeness. He cannot <em>lose</em> this, but <em>you</em> can not <em>know</em>\nit. Yet it is still His Will for you, and His Will <em>must</em> stand forever\nand in all things.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>90</sup> Fear of the Will of God is one of the strangest beliefs that the\nhuman mind has ever made. This could not possibly have occurred unless\nthe mind were <em>already</em> profoundly split, making it possible for the\nmind to be <em>afraid</em> of what it really is. It is apparent that reality\ncannot “threaten” anything <em>except</em> illusions, since reality can only\nuphold truth. The very fact that the Will of God, which is what you\n<em>are</em>, is perceived as fearful to you demonstrates that you <em>are</em> afraid\nof what you are. It is not, then, the Will of God of which you <em>are</em>\nafraid, but <em>yours</em>. Your will is <em>not</em> the ego’s, and that is <em>why</em> the\nego is against you. What seems to be the fear of God is really only the\nfear <em>of your own reality.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>91</sup> It is impossible to learn anything consistently in a state of panic.\nIf the purpose of this course is to learn what you are and if you have\nalready <em>decided</em> that what you are is fearful, then it <em>must</em> follow\nthat you will <em>not</em> learn this course. Yet you might remember that the\nreason <em>for</em> the course is that you do <em>not</em> know who you are. If you do\nnot know your reality, how would you know whether it is fearful or not?</p>\n\n<p><sup>92</sup> The association of truth and fear, which would be highly artificial\nat most, is particularly inappropriate in the minds of those who do not\nknow what truth <em>is</em>. All that this kind of association means is that\nyou are arbitrarily endowing something quite beyond your awareness with\nsomething you <em>do not want</em>. It is evident, then, that you are judging\nsomething of which you are totally <em>unaware</em>. You have set this strange\nsituation up so that it is completely impossible to escape from it\n<em>without</em> a Guide who <em>does</em> know what your reality is. The purpose of\nthis Guide is merely to remind you of what you <em>want</em>. He is not\nattempting to force an alien will <em>upon</em> you. He is merely making every\npossible effort, within the limits you impose on Him, to <em>re-establish</em>\nyour own will in your consciousness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>93</sup> You have <em>imprisoned</em> your will in your <em>unconscious</em>, where it\nremains available but cannot help you. When we said that the Holy\nSpirit’s function is to sort out the true from the false in your\nunconscious, we meant that He has the power to look into what <em>you</em> have\nhidden and perceive the Will of God there. <em>His</em> perception of this will\ncan make it real to <em>you</em> because He is in your mind and therefore He\n<em>is</em> your reality. If, then, His perception of your mind brings its\nreality to <em>you</em>, He <em>is</em> teaching you what you are.</p>\n\n<p><sup>94</sup> The only source of fear in this whole process can <em>only</em> be what you\nthink you <em>lose</em>. Yet it is only what the Holy Spirit sees that you can\npossibly <em>have.</em> We have emphasized many times that the Holy Spirit will\nnever call upon you to sacrifice <em>anything</em>. But if you ask the\nsacrifice of reality of <em>yourselves</em>, the Holy Spirit <em>must</em> remind you\nthat this is not God’s Will <em>because</em> it is not yours. There is <em>no\ndifference</em> between your will and God’s. If you did not have split\nminds, you would recognize that willing is salvation <em>because</em> it is\ncommunication. It is impossible to communicate in alien tongues. You and\nyour Creator can communicate through creation because that, and <em>only</em>\nthat, <em>is</em> your joint will.</p>\n\n<p><sup>95</sup> Divided wills do not communicate because they speak for different\nthings <em>to the same mind</em>. This loses the ability to communicate simply\nbecause confused communication does not mean <em>anything.</em> A message\ncannot be said to be communicated <em>unless</em> it makes sense. How sensible\ncan your messages be when you ask for what you do <em>not</em> want? Yet as\nlong as you are <em>afraid</em> of your will, this is precisely what you <em>will</em>\nask for. You may insist that the Holy Spirit does not answer you, but it\nmight be wiser to consider the kind of <em>asker</em> you are.</p>\n\n<p><sup>96</sup> You do <em>not</em> ask only for what you want. This is <em>solely</em> because you\nare afraid you might <em>receive</em> it, <em>and you would</em>. That is really why\nyou persist in asking the teacher who could not possibly <em>teach</em> you\nyour will. Of him you can <em>never</em> learn it, and this gives you the\nillusion of safety. Yet you cannot be safe <em>from</em> truth but only <em>in</em>\nit. Reality is the <em>only</em> safety. Your will is your salvation <em>because</em>\nit is the same as God’s. The separation is nothing more than the belief\nthat it is <em>different</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>97</sup> No mind can believe that its will is <em>stronger</em> than God’s. If, then,\na mind believes that <em>its</em> will is different from His, it can only\ndecide either that there <em>is</em> no God or that <em>God’s Will is fearful</em>.\nThe former accounts for the atheist and the latter for the martyr.\nMartyrdom takes many forms, the category including <em>all</em> doctrines which\nhold that God demands sacrifices of <em>any</em> kind. Either basic type of\ninsane decision will induce panic, because the atheist believes he is\nalone, and the martyr believes that God is crucifying him. Both really\nfear abandonment and retaliation, but the atheist is more reactive\nagainst abandonment and the martyr against retaliation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>98</sup> The atheist maintains that God has left him, but he does not care. He\nwill, however, become very fearful and hence very angry if anyone\nsuggests that God has <em>not</em> left him. The martyr, on the other hand, is\nmore aware of guilt and, believing that punishment is inevitable,\nattempts to teach himself to <em>like</em> it. The truth is, very simply, that\nno one wants <em>either</em> abandonment <em>or</em> retaliation. Many people <em>seek</em>\nboth, but it is still true that they do not <em>want</em> them. Can you ask the\nHoly Spirit for “gifts” such as these and actually expect to <em>receive</em>\nthem? [The Holy Spirit is totally incapable of giving you anything that\ndoes not come from God. His task is not to make anything for you.] He\ncannot make you want something you do <em>not</em> want. When you ask the\nUniversal Giver for what you do not want, you are asking for what\n<em>cannot</em> be given, <em>because it was never created</em>. It was never created,\nbecause it was never your will for <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>99</sup> Ultimately everyone must remember the Will of God, because ultimately\neveryone must recognize <em>himself</em>. This recognition <em>is</em> the recognition\nthat <em>his will and God’s are one</em>. In the presence of truth, there are\n<em>no</em> unbelievers and <em>no</em> sacrifices. In the security of reality, fear\nis totally meaningless. To deny what <em>is</em> can only <em>seem</em> to be fearful.\nFear cannot be real without a cause, and God is the <em>only</em> Cause. God is\nLove, and you <em>do</em> want Him. This <em>is</em> your will. Ask for this and you\n<em>will</em> be answered because you will be asking only for what <em>belongs</em> to\nyou.</p>\n\n<p><sup>100</sup> When you ask the Holy Spirit for what would hurt you, He cannot\nanswer, because <em>nothing</em> can hurt you <em>and so you are asking for\nnothing</em>. <em>Any</em> desire which stems from the ego <em>is</em> a desire for\nnothing and to ask for it is <em>not a request</em>. It is merely a denial in\nthe <em>form</em> of a request. The Holy Spirit is not concerned with form at\nall, being aware only of <em>meaning</em>. The ego cannot ask the Holy Spirit\nfor <em>anything</em> because there is <em>complete communication failure</em> between\nthem. Yet <em>you</em> can ask for <em>everything</em> of the Holy Spirit because\n<em>your</em> requests are real, being of your will. Would the Holy Spirit deny\nthe Will of God? And could He fail to recognize it in His Sons?</p>\n\n<p><sup>101</sup> The energy which you withdraw from creation you expend on fear. This\nis not because your energy is limited but because <em>you have limited it.</em>\nYou do not recognize the enormous waste of energy which you expend in\ndenying truth. What would you say of someone who persisted in attempting\nthe impossible, believing that to <em>achieve</em> it is <em>success</em>? The belief\nthat you <em>must</em> have the impossible in order to be happy is totally at\nvariance with the principle of creation. God <em>could</em> not will that\nhappiness <em>depended</em> on what you could never <em>have.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>102</sup> The fact that God is love does not require belief, but it <em>does</em>\nrequire acceptance. It is indeed possible for you to <em>deny</em> facts,\nalthough it is impossible for you to <em>change</em> them. If you hold your\nhands over your eyes, you will <em>not</em> see because you are interfering\nwith the laws of seeing. If you deny love, you will <em>not</em> know it\nbecause your cooperation is <em>the law of its being</em>. You cannot change\nlaws you did not make, and the laws of happiness were created <em>for</em> you,\nnot <em>by</em> you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>103</sup> Attempts of any kind to deny what <em>is</em> are fearful, and if they are\nstrong, they <em>will</em> induce panic. Willing <em>against</em> reality, though\nimpossible, can be <em>made</em> into a very persistent goal, <em>even though you\ndo not want it.</em> But consider the result of this strange decision. You\nare <em>devoting</em> your mind to what you do not want. How real can this\ndevotion <em>be</em>? If you do not want it, it was never created. If it was\nnever created, it is nothing. Can you <em>really</em> devote yourself to\nnothing?</p>\n\n<p><sup>104</sup> God in His devotion to you created you devoted to <em>everything</em> and\n<em>gave</em> you what you are devoted to. Otherwise, you would not have been\ncreated perfect. Reality <em>is</em> everything, and therefore you have\neverything <em>because</em> you are real. You cannot make the unreal, because\nthe <em>absence</em> of reality is fearful, and fear cannot <em>be</em> created. As\nlong as you believe that fear is possible, <em>you will not create</em>.\nOpposing orders of reality <em>make reality meaningless</em>, and reality <em>is</em>\nmeaning.</p>\n\n<p><sup>105</sup> Remember, then, that God’s Will is <em>already</em> possible and nothing\nelse will <em>ever</em> be. This is the simple acceptance of reality, because\nonly this <em>is</em> real. You cannot <em>distort</em> reality and <em>know what it is</em>.\nAnd if you <em>do</em> distort reality, you will experience anxiety,\ndepression, and ultimately panic, because you are trying to <em>make</em>\nyourself unreal. When you feel these things, do not try to look <em>beyond</em>\nyourself for truth, for truth can only be <em>within</em> you. Say, therefore,</p>\n\n<p><sup>106</sup> <em>Christ is in me, and where He is God <strong>must</strong> be, for Christ\nis <strong>part</strong> of Him.</em></p>\n\n",

This is not only true in\nconnection with specific things which might be harmful but also in\nconnection with requests which are strictly in line with this course.\nThe latter, in particular, might be incorrectly interpreted as “proof”\nthat the course does not mean what it says. You must remember, however,\nthat the course does state, and repeatedly, that its purpose is the\n<em>escape</em> from fear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>108</sup> Let us suppose, then, that what you request of the Holy Spirit <em>is</em>\nwhat you really want, but you are still <em>afraid</em> of it. Should this be\nthe case, your <em>attainment</em> of it would no longer <em>be</em> what you want,\neven if <em>it</em> is. This accounts for why certain <em>specific</em> forms of\nhealing are not achieved, even though the state of healing <em>is.</em> It\nfrequently happens that an individual asks for physical healing because\nhe is fearful of <em>bodily</em> harm. At the same time, however, if he <em>were</em>\nhealed physically, the threat to his thought system would be\nconsiderably <em>more</em> fearful to him than its physical expression. In this\ncase he is not really asking for <em>release</em> from fear but for the removal\nof a symptom which <em>he</em> has selected. This request is, therefore, <em>not</em>\nfor healing at all.</p>\n\n<p><sup>109</sup> The Bible emphasizes that <em>all</em> prayers are answered, and this must\nbe true if no effort is wasted. The very fact that one has asked the\nHoly Spirit for <em>anything</em> will ensure a response. Yet it is equally\ncertain that <em>no</em> response given by the Holy Spirit will <em>ever</em> be one\nwhich would increase fear. It is possible that His answer will not be\nheard at all. It is <em>impossible</em>, however, that it will be lost. There\nare many answers which you have already received but have not yet\n<em>heard</em>. I assure you that they are waiting for you. It is indeed true\nthat no effort is wasted.</p>\n\n<p><sup>110</sup> If you would know your prayers are answered, never doubt a Son of\nGod. Do not question him and do not confound him, for your faith in him\nis your faith in <em>yourself</em>. If you would know God and His Answer,\nbelieve in me whose faith in you cannot be shaken. Can you ask of the\nHoly Spirit truly and doubt your brother? Believe his words are true\nbecause of the truth which is <em>in</em> him. You will unite with the truth in\nhim, and his words will <em>be</em> true. As you hear <em>him</em>, you will hear\n<em>me.</em> <em>Listening</em> to truth is the only way you can hear it now and\nfinally <em>know</em> it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>111</sup> The message your brother gives you is <em>up to you</em>. What does he say\nto you? What would you <em>have</em> him say? Your decision <em>about</em> him\ndetermines the message you receive. Remember that the Holy Spirit is in\nhim, and His Voice speaks to you <em>through</em> him. What can so holy a\nbrother tell you <em>except</em> truth? But are you <em>listening</em> to it? Your\nbrother may not know who he is, but there is a light in his mind which\n<em>does</em> know. This light can shine into yours, making <em>his</em> words true\nand making <em>you</em> able to hear them. His words <em>are</em> the Holy Spirit’s\nanswer to you. Is your faith in him strong enough to let you hear?</p>\n\n<p><sup>112</sup> Salvation is of your brother. The Holy Spirit extends from your mind\nto his and answers <em>you</em>. You cannot hear the Voice for God in yourself\nalone because you are <em>not</em> alone. And His answer is only for what you\n<em>are</em>. You will not know the trust I have in you unless you <em>extend</em> it.\nYou will not trust the guidance of the Holy Spirit or believe that it is\nfor you unless you hear it in others. It <em>must</em> be for your brother\n<em>because</em> it is for you. Would God have created a Voice for you alone?\nCould you hear His answer <em>except</em> as He answers <em>all</em> of God’s Sons?\nHear of your brother what you would have me hear of you, for you would\nnot want <em>me</em> to be deceived.</p>\n\n<p><sup>113</sup> I love you for the truth in you, as God does. Your deceptions may\ndeceive <em>you</em>, but they <em>cannot</em> deceive <em>me</em>. Knowing what you are, I\n<em>cannot</em> doubt you. I hear only the Holy Spirit in you, who speaks to me\nthrough <em>you</em>. If you would hear <em>me</em>, hear my brothers in whom God’s\nVoice speaks. The answer to <em>all</em> prayers lies in them. You will be\nanswered as you hear the answer in <em>everyone</em>. Do not listen to anything\nelse, or you will not hear truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>114</sup> Believe in your brothers <em>because</em> I believe in you, and you will\nlearn that my belief in you is justified. Believe in me <em>by</em> believing\nin them for the sake of what God gave them. They <em>will</em> answer you if\nyou learn to ask truth of them. Do not ask for blessings without\nblessing them, for only in this way can you learn how blessed <em>you</em> are.\nBy following this way, you <em>are</em> looking for the truth in you. This is\nnot going <em>beyond</em> yourself but <em>toward</em> yourself. Hear only God’s\nAnswer in His Sons, and you <em>are</em> answered.</p>\n\n<p><sup>115</sup> To disbelieve is to side against or to <em>attack</em>. To believe is to\naccept and to <em>side with</em>. To believe is not to be credulous but to\naccept and <em>appreciate</em>. What you do not believe, you do not appreciate,\nand you <em>cannot</em> be grateful for what you do not value. There is a price\nyou will pay for judgment because judgment <em>is</em> the setting of a price.\nAnd as you set it, you <em>will</em> pay it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>116</sup> If paying is equated with <em>getting</em>, you will set the price low but\ndemand a high <em>return</em>. You will have forgotten, however, that [to\nprice is to value, so] your return is in <em>proportion</em> to your judgment\nof worth. If paying is associated with <em>giving</em>, it cannot be perceived\nas loss, and the <em>reciprocal</em> relationship of giving and receiving will\nbe recognized. The price will then be set high because of the value of\nthe return. The price for <em>getting</em> is to lose sight of value, making it\ninevitable that you will <em>not</em> value what you receive. Valuing it\nlittle, you will not appreciate it and will not <em>want</em> it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>117</sup> Never forget, then, that <em>you</em> have set the value on what you\nreceive and have priced it by what you give. To believe that it is\npossible to get much for little is to believe that you can bargain with\nGod. God’s laws are <em>always</em> fair and perfectly consistent. <em>By</em> giving\nyou receive. But to receive is to <em>accept</em>, not to get. It is impossible\nnot to <em>have</em>, but it <em>is</em> possible not to <em>know</em> you have. The\nrecognition of having is the willingness for <em>giving</em>, and <em>only</em> by\nthis willingness can you recognize what you have. What you give is\ntherefore the value you put on what you have, being the exact measure of\nthe value you put upon it. And this, in turn, is the measure of how much\nyou <em>want</em> it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>118</sup> You can <em>ask</em> of the Holy Spirit, then, only by giving <em>to</em> Him, and\nyou can <em>give</em> to Him only where you <em>see</em> Him. If you see Him in\neveryone, consider how much you will be <em>asking</em> of Him and <em>how much\nyou will receive</em>. He will deny you nothing because you have denied\n<em>Him</em> nothing, and so you can share everything. This is the way, and the\n<em>only</em> way, to have His answer because His answer is all you <em>can</em> ask\nfor and <em>want</em>. Say, then, to everyone,</p>\n\n<p><sup>119</sup> <em>Because I will to know myself, I see you as God’s Son and my\nbrother.</em></p>\n\n",

Unless this becomes the one way in\nwhich you handle <em>all</em> errors, you cannot understand how all errors are\n<em>undone.</em> How is this different from telling you that what you teach you\nlearn?

His errors cannot change\nthis and can have no effect at all on the truth in <em>you</em>. To perceive\nerrors in anyone and to react to them as if they were real is to <em>make</em>\nthem real to you.

    "content": "<p><sup>9</sup> Atonement is for all, because it is the way to <em>undo</em> the belief that\nanything is for you alone. To forgive is to <em>overlook</em>. Look, then,\n<em>beyond</em> error, and do not let your perception rest <em>upon</em> it, for you\nwill believe what your perception holds. Accept as true only what your\nbrother <em>is</em> if you would know yourself. Perceive what he is <em>not</em>, and\nyou cannot know what you are, <em>because</em> you see him falsely. Remember\nalways that your identity is shared and that its sharing <em>is</em> its\nreality.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> You have a part to play in the Atonement, but the plan of the\nAtonement <em>is</em> beyond you. You do not know how to overlook errors, or\nyou would not make them. It would merely be further error to think\neither that you do <em>not</em> make them or that you can correct them\n<em>without</em> a Guide to correction. And if you do not <em>follow</em> this Guide,\nyour errors will <em>not</em> be corrected. The plan is not yours, <em>because</em> of\nyour limited ideas of what you are. This limitation is where <em>all</em>\nerrors arise. The way to undo them, therefore, is not <em>of</em> you but <em>for</em>\nyou.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> The Atonement is a lesson in sharing, which is given you because <em>you\nhave forgotten how to do it</em>. The Holy Spirit merely reminds you of what\nis your natural ability. By reinterpreting the ability to attack, which\nyou <em>did</em> make, into the ability to <em>share</em>, He translates what you have\nmade into what God created. If you would accomplish this <em>through</em> Him,\nyou cannot look on your abilities through the eyes of the ego, or you\nwill judge them as <em>it</em> does. All their harmfulness lies in its\njudgment. All their helpfulness lies in the judgment of the Holy Spirit.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> The ego, too, has a plan of forgiveness because you are <em>asking</em> for\none, though not of the right teacher. The ego’s plan, of course, <em>makes\nno sense</em> and <em>will not work.</em> By following it, you will merely place\nyourself in an impossible situation to which the ego <em>always</em> leads you.\nThe ego’s plan is to have you see error clearly <em>first</em> and <em>then</em>\noverlook it. Yet how can you overlook what you have made real? By seeing\nit clearly, you <em>have</em> made it real and <em>cannot</em> overlook it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> This is where the ego is forced to appeal to “mysteries” and begins\nto insist that you must accept the meaningless to save yourself. Many\nhave tried to do this in my name, forgetting that my words make\n<em>perfect</em> sense because they come from God. They are as sensible now as\nthey ever were, because they speak of ideas which are eternal.\nForgiveness that is learned of me does <em>not</em> use fear to <em>undo</em> fear.\nNor does it make real the <em>unreal</em> and then destroy it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> Forgiveness through the Holy Spirit lies simply in looking beyond\nerror from the beginning and thus <em>keeping</em> it unreal for you. Do not\nlet any belief in its realness enter your minds <em>at all</em>, or you will\nalso believe that <em>you</em> must undo what you have made in order to be\nforgiven. What has no effect does not exist, and to the Holy Spirit, the\neffects of error are <em>totally</em> non-existent. By steadily and\nconsistently canceling out <em>all</em> its effects <em>everywhere</em> and in <em>all</em>\nrespects, He teaches that the ego does not exist and <em>proves</em> it. Follow\nHis teaching in forgiveness then, because forgiveness <em>is</em> His function,\nand He knows how to fulfill it perfectly. That is what we meant when we\nonce said that miracles are <em>natural</em>, and when they do <em>not</em> occur,\nsomething has gone wrong.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> Miracles are merely the sign of your willingness to follow the Holy\nSpirit’s plan of salvation in recognition of the fact that you do <em>not</em>\nknow what it is. His work is <em>not</em> your function, and unless you accept\nthis, you cannot learn what <em>your</em> function is. The confusion of\nfunctions is so typical of the ego that you should be quite familiar\nwith it by now. The ego believes that <em>all</em> functions belong to it, even\nthough it has no idea what they <em>are</em>. This is more than mere confusion.\nIt is a particularly dangerous combination of grandiosity <em>and</em>\nconfusion which makes it likely that the ego will attack anyone and\nanything for no reason at all. This is exactly what the ego <em>does</em>. It\nis <em>totally</em> unpredictable in its responses, because it has no idea of\n<em>what</em> it perceives.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> If one has no idea of what is happening, how appropriately can you\n<em>expect</em> him to react? You might still ask yourself, regardless of how\nyou can <em>account</em> for the reactions, whether they place the ego in a\nvery sound position as the guide for <em>yours</em>. It seems absurd to have to\nemphasize repeatedly that the ego’s qualifications as a guide are\nsingularly unfortunate and that it is a remarkably poor choice as a\nteacher of salvation. Yet this question, ridiculous as it seems, is\nreally the crucial issue in the whole separation fantasy. Anyone who\nelects a totally insane guide <em>must</em> be totally insane himself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> It is not true that you do not know the guide is insane. <em>You</em> know\nit because <em>I</em> know it, and you <em>have</em> judged it by the same standard as\nI have. The ego literally lives on borrowed time, and its days are\nnumbered. Do not fear the Last Judgment, but welcome it and do not wait,\nfor the ego’s time is borrowed from <em>your</em> eternity. This <em>is</em> the\nSecond Coming, which was made <em>for</em> you as the First was created. The\nSecond Coming is merely the return of <em>sense</em>. Can this <em>possibly</em> be\nfearful?</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> What can be fearful but fantasy, and no one turns to fantasy unless\nhe despairs of finding satisfaction in reality. Yet it is certain that\nhe will <em>never</em> find satisfaction in fantasy, so that his only hope is\nto <em>change his mind about reality</em>. Only if the decision that reality is\nfearful is <em>wrong</em> can God be right. And I assure you that God <em>is</em>\nright. Be glad, then, that you <em>have</em> been wrong, but this was only\nbecause you did not know who you were. Had you remembered, you could no\nmore have been wrong than God can. The impossible can happen <em>only</em> in\nfantasy. When you search for reality in fantasies, you will not find it.\nThe symbols of fantasy are of the ego, and of <em>these</em> you will find\nmany. But do not look for meaning in them. They have no more meaning\nthan the fantasies into which they are woven.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> Fairy tales can be pleasant or fearful, pretty or ugly, but no one\ncalls them <em>true</em>. Children may believe them, and so for a while the\ntales <em>are</em> true for them. Yet when reality dawns, the fantasies are\ngone. <em>Reality</em> has not gone in the meanwhile. The Second Coming is the\n<em>awareness</em> of reality, not its <em>return</em>. Behold, my children, reality\nis here. It belongs to you and me and God and is perfectly satisfying to\nall of us. <em>Only</em> this awareness heals, because it is the awareness of\ntruth.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>20</sup> The ego’s plan for forgiveness is far more widely used than God’s.\nThis is because it is undertaken by unhealed healers and is therefore of\nthe ego. Let us consider the unhealed healer more carefully now. By\ndefinition, he is trying to <em>give</em> what he has not <em>received.</em> If he is\na theologian, he may begin with the premise, “I am a miserable sinner\nand so are you.” If he is a psychotherapist, he is more likely to start\nwith the equally incredible idea that <em>he</em> really believes in attack and\nso does the patient, but it does not matter in either case.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> We have repeatedly stated that beliefs of the ego cannot be shared,\nand this is <em>why</em> they are unreal. How, then, can “uncovering” them\n<em>make</em> them real? Every healer who searches fantasies for truth <em>must</em>\nbe unhealed, because he does not <em>know</em> where to look for truth and\ntherefore does not have the answer to the problem of healing. There is\nan advantage to bringing nightmares into awareness, but <em>only</em> to teach\nthat they are not real and that <em>anything</em> they contain is meaningless.\nThe unhealed healer cannot do this, because he does not <em>believe</em> it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> All unhealed healers follow the ego’s plan for forgiveness in one\nform or another. If they are theologians, they are likely to condemn\nthemselves, teach condemnation, and advocate a very fearful solution.\nProjecting condemnation onto God, they make Him appear retaliative and\nfear His retribution. What they have done is merely to <em>identify</em> with\nthe ego and, by perceiving clearly what <em>it</em> does, condemn themselves\nbecause of this profound confusion. It is understandable that there has\nbeen a revolt against this concept, but to revolt <em>against</em> it is still\nto <em>believe</em> in it. The <em>form</em> of the revolt, then, is different but\n<em>not</em> the content.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> The newer forms of the ego’s plan are as unhelpful as the older ones,\nbecause form does not matter to the Holy Spirit and therefore does not\nmatter at all. According to the newer forms of the ego’s plan, the\ntherapist interprets the ego’s symbols in the nightmare and then uses\nthem to prove that the <em>nightmare</em> is real. Having <em>made</em> it real, he\nthen attempts to dispel its effects by depreciating the importance <em>of\nthe dreamer</em>. This <em>would</em> be a healing approach if the dreamer were\nproperly identified as unreal. Yet if the dreamer is equated with the\n<em>mind</em>, the mind’s corrective power through the Holy Spirit is <em>denied</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> It is noteworthy that this is a contradiction even in the ego’s\nterms, and one which it usually <em>does</em> note, even in its confusion. If\nthe way to counteract fear is to <em>reduce</em> the importance of the fearer,\nhow can this build ego <em>strength</em>? These perfectly self-evident\ninconsistencies account for why, except in certain stylized verbal\naccounts, no one can <em>explain</em> what happens in psychotherapy. Nothing\nreal <em>does</em>. Nothing real has happened to the unhealed healer, and he\nlearns from his own teaching.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> <em>Because</em> his ego is involved, it always attempts to gain some\nsupport from the situation. Seeking to get something for <em>himself</em>, the\nunhealed healer does not know how to <em>give</em> and consequently cannot\nshare. He cannot correct because he is not working <em>correctively</em>. He\nbelieves that it is up to him to teach the patient what is <em>real</em>, but\nhe does not know it himself. What, then, <em>should</em> happen? When God said,\n“Let there be light,” there <em>was</em> light. Can you find light by analyzing\ndarkness as the psychotherapist does or like the theologian, by\nacknowledging darkness in yourself and looking for a distant light to\nremove it while <em>emphasizing</em> the distance?</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> Healing is <em>not</em> mysterious. Nothing will occur unless you understand\nit, since light <em>is</em> understanding. A “miserable sinner” cannot be\nhealed without magic, nor can an “unimportant mind” esteem itself\nwithout magic. Both forms of the ego’s approach, then, must arrive at an\nimpasse, the characteristic “impossible situation” to which the ego\n<em>always</em> leads. It <em>can</em> be helpful to point out to a patient where he\nis heading, but the point is lost unless he can change his direction.\nThe therapist cannot do this for him, but he also cannot do this for\n<em>himself</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> The <em>only</em> meaningful contribution the therapist can make is to\npresent an example of one whose direction has been changed <em>for</em> him and\nwho no longer believes in nightmares of <em>any</em> kind. The light in <em>his</em>\nmind will therefore <em>answer</em> the questioner, who must decide with God\nthat there <em>is</em> light because he <em>sees</em> it. And by <em>his</em> acknowledgment,\nthe <em>therapist</em> knows it is there. That is how perception ultimately is\ntranslated into knowledge. The miracle worker begins by <em>perceiving</em>\nlight and translates <em>his</em> perception into sureness by continually\nextending it and accepting its acknowledgment. Its <em>effects</em> assure him\nit is there.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> The therapist does not heal; <em>he lets healing be</em>. He can point to\ndarkness, but he cannot bring light of <em>himself</em>, for light is not of\nhim. Yet, being <em>for</em> him, it must also be for his patient. The Holy\nSpirit is the <em>only</em> therapist. He makes healing perfectly clear in\n<em>any</em> situation in which he is the Guide. The human therapist can only\nlet Him <em>fulfill</em> His function. He needs no help for this. He will tell\nyou <em>exactly</em> what to do to help <em>anyone</em> He sends to you for help and\nwill speak to him through you if you do not <em>interfere.</em> Remember that\nyou <em>are</em> choosing a guide for helping, and the <em>wrong</em> choice will\n<em>not</em> help. But remember also that the <em>right</em> one <em>will.</em> Trust Him,\nfor help is His function, and He is of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> As you awaken other minds to the Holy Spirit through Him and <em>not</em>\nyourself, you will understand that you are not obeying the laws of this\nworld, but that the laws you are obeying <em>work</em>. “The good is what\nworks” is a sound, though insufficient, statement. <em>Only</em> the good <em>can</em>\nwork. Nothing else works at all. This course is a guide to behavior.\nBeing a very direct and very simple learning situation, it provides the\nGuide who <em>tells</em> you what to do. If you do it, you will <em>see</em> that it\nworks. Its <em>results</em> are more convincing than its words. They will\nconvince you that the words are true. By following the right Guide you\nwill learn the simplest of all lessons—</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> <em>By their fruits ye shall know them, and <strong>they</strong> shall know\n<strong>themselves</strong>.</em></p>\n\n",

As you see them waken, you\nwill learn what waking <em>means</em>, and because you have willed to wake\nthem, their gratitude and their appreciation of what you have given them\nwill teach <em>you</em> its value. <em>They</em> will become the witnesses to your\nreality, as <em>you</em> were created witnesses to God’s. Yet when the Sonship\ncomes together and <em>accepts</em> its oneness, it will be known by its\ncreations, who witness to its reality as the Son does to the Father.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> Miracles have no place in eternity because they are reparative. Yet\nwhile you still need healing, your miracles are the only witnesses to\nyour reality which you can <em>recognize.</em> You cannot perform a miracle for\n<em>yourself</em>, because miracles are a way of <em>giving</em> acceptance <em>and</em>\nreceiving it. In time, the giving comes first, though they are\nsimultaneous in eternity, where they cannot <em>be</em> separated. When you\nhave learned that they <em>are</em> the same, the need for time is over.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> Eternity is <em>one</em> time, its only dimension being “always.” This\ncannot mean anything to you, however, until you remember God’s open arms\nand finally know His open mind. Like Him, <em>you</em> are “always,” in His\nMind and with a mind like His. In <em>your</em> open mind are <em>your</em> creations,\nin perfect communication born of perfect understanding. Could you but\naccept one of them, you would not want <em>anything</em> the world has to\noffer. Everything else would be totally meaningless. God’s meaning is\nincomplete without you, and you are incomplete without your creations.\nAccept your brother in this world and accept <em>nothing else</em>, for in him\nyou will find your creations, because he created them <em>with</em> you. You\nwill never know that you are co-creator with God until you learn that\nyour brother is a co-creator with <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>38</sup> God’s Will is your salvation. Would He not have given you the means\nto find it? If He wills you to <em>have</em> it, He must have made it possible\nand very easy to obtain it. Your brothers are everywhere. You do not\nhave to seek far for salvation. Every minute and every second gives you\na chance to save <em>yourself</em>. Do not lose these chances, not because they\nwill not return, but because delay of joy is needless. God wills you\nperfect happiness <em>now</em>. Is it possible that this is not also <em>your</em>\nwill? And is it possible that this is not <em>also</em> the will of your\nbrothers?</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> Consider, then, that in this joint will you <em>are</em> all united, and in\nthis <em>only</em>. There will be disagreement on anything else, but <em>not</em> on\nthis. This, then, is where peace <em>abides</em>. And <em>you</em> abide in peace when\nyou so decide. Yet you cannot abide in peace unless you accept the\nAtonement, because the Atonement <em>is</em> the way to peace. The reason is\nvery simple and so obvious that it is often overlooked. That is because\nthe ego is <em>afraid</em> of the obvious since obviousness is the essential\ncharacteristic of reality. Yet <em>you</em> cannot overlook it unless you are\n<em>not looking.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> It is <em>perfectly</em> obvious that if the Holy Spirit looks with love on\n<em>all</em> He perceives, He looks with love on <em>you</em>. His evaluation of you\nis based on His knowledge of what you are, and so He evaluates you\ntruly. And this evaluation <em>must</em> be in your mind because <em>He</em> is. The\nego is also in your mind, because you have <em>accepted</em> it there. <em>Its</em>\nevaluation of you, however, is the exact opposite of the Holy Spirit’s,\nbecause the ego does <em>not</em> love you. It is unaware of what you are and\nwholly mistrustful of <em>everything</em> it perceives, because its own\nperceptions are so shifting. The ego is therefore capable of\nsuspiciousness at best and viciousness at worst. That is its range. It\ncannot exceed it because of its uncertainty. And it can never go\n<em>beyond</em> it, because it can never <em>be</em> certain.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> You, then, have two <em>conflicting</em> evaluations of yourself in your\nminds, and they <em>cannot</em> both be true. You do not yet realize how\n<em>completely</em> different these evaluations are, because you do not\nunderstand how lofty the Holy Spirit’s perception of you really is. He\nis not deceived by anything you do, because He never forgets what you\n<em>are</em>. The ego is deceived by everything you do, even when you respond\nto the Holy Spirit, because at such times its confusion <em>increases</em>. The\nego is, therefore, particularly likely to attack you when you react\nlovingly, because it has evaluated you as <em>unloving</em>, and you are going\n<em>against</em> its judgment.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> The ego will begin to <em>attack</em> your motives as soon as they become\nclearly out of accord with its perception of you. This is when it will\nshift abruptly from suspiciousness to viciousness, since its uncertainty\nis increased. Yet it is surely pointless to attack in return. What can\nthis mean except that you are <em>agreeing</em> with the ego’s evaluation of\nwhat you are? If you are willing to see yourself as unloving, you will\n<em>not</em> be happy. You are condemning yourself and <em>must</em> therefore regard\nyourself as inadequate. Would you look to the ego to help you escape\nfrom a sense of inadequacy it has <em>produced</em> and must <em>maintain</em> for its\nexistence? Can you <em>escape</em> from its evaluation of you by using its\nmethods for keeping this picture <em>intact</em>?</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> You cannot evaluate an insane belief system from <em>within</em> it. Its own\nrange precludes this. You can only go <em>beyond</em> it, look back from a\npoint where <em>sanity</em> exists, <em>and</em> <em>see the contrast</em>. Only <em>by</em> this\ncontrast can insanity be judged as insane. With the grandeur of God in\nyou, you have chosen to be little and to lament your littleness.\n<em>Within</em> the system which dictated this choice, the lament <em>is</em>\ninevitable. Your littleness is taken for granted there, and you do <em>not</em>\nask, “Who granted it?” The question is meaningless within the ego’s\nthought system, because it opens the <em>whole</em> thought system to question.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> We said before that the ego does not know what a real question is.\nLack of knowledge of any kind is always associated with <em>unwillingness</em>\nto know and produces a total lack of knowledge simply because knowledge\n<em>is</em> total. <em>Not</em> to question your littleness, therefore, is to deny\n<em>all</em> knowledge and keep the ego’s <em>whole</em> thought system intact. You\ncannot retain <em>part</em> of a thought system, because it can be questioned\n<em>only</em> at its foundation. And this must be questioned from beyond it,\nbecause, <em>within</em> it, its foundation <em>does</em> stand. The Holy Spirit\njudges against the reality of the ego’s thought system merely because He\nknows its <em>foundation</em> is not true. Therefore, nothing that arises from\nit means anything. The Holy Spirit judges every belief you hold in terms\nof where it comes from. If it comes from God, He knows it to be true. If\nit does not, He knows that it is meaningless.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> Whenever you question your value, say:</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> <em>God Himself is incomplete without me</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> Remember this when the ego speaks, and you will not hear it. The\ntruth about you is so lofty that nothing unworthy of God is worthy of\nyou. Choose, then, what you want in these terms and accept nothing that\nyou would not offer to God as wholly fitting for Him, for you do not\n<em>want</em> anything else. Return your part of Him, and He will give you all\nof Himself in exchange for your return of what belongs to Him and\nrenders Him complete.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>48</sup> Grandeur is of God and <em>only</em> of Him. Therefore, it is in you.\nWhenever you become aware of it, however dimly, you abandon the ego\nautomatically, because in the presence of the grandeur of God the\nmeaninglessness of the ego becomes perfectly apparent. Though it does\nnot understand this, the ego believes that its “enemy” has struck and\nattempts to offer gifts to induce you to return to its “protection.”\n<em>Self</em>-inflation [is the only offering it can make. The grandiosity]\nof the ego is its alternative to the grandeur of God. Which will you\nchoose?</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> Grandiosity is <em>always</em> a cover for despair. It is without hope\nbecause it is not real. It is an attempt to counteract your littleness,\nbased on the belief that the littleness is <em>real</em>. Without this belief,\ngrandiosity is meaningless, and you could not possibly want it. The\nessence of grandiosity is competitiveness, because it <em>always</em> involves\nattack. It is a delusional attempt to <em>outdo</em> but <em>not</em> to undo. We said\nbefore that the ego vacillates between suspiciousness and viciousness.\nIt remains suspicious as long as you despair of yourself. It shifts to\nviciousness whenever you will not tolerate self-abasement and seek\nrelief. Then it offers you the illusion of attack as a solution.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> The ego does not know the difference between grandeur and\ngrandiosity, because it does not know the difference between miracle\nimpulses and ego-alien beliefs of its own. We once said that the ego\n<em>is</em> aware of threat, but does not make distinctions between two\nentirely different kinds of threat to its existence. Its own profound\nsense of vulnerability renders it incapable of judgment <em>except</em> in\nterms of attack. When it experiences threat, its only decision is\nwhether to attack <em>now</em> or to withdraw to attack later. If you accept\nits offer of grandiosity, it will attack immediately. If you do not, it\nwill wait.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> The ego is immobilized in the presence of God’s grandeur, because\n<em>His</em> grandeur establishes <em>your</em> freedom. Even the faintest hint of\nyour reality literally drives the ego from your mind because of complete\nlack of investment in it. Grandeur is totally <em>without</em> illusions, and\nbecause it is real, it is compellingly convincing. Yet the conviction of\nreality will not remain with you unless you do not allow the ego to\nattack it. The ego will make every effort to recover and mobilize its\nenergies <em>against</em> your release. It will tell you that you are insane\nand argue that grandeur <em>cannot</em> be a real part of you because of the\nlittleness in which <em>it</em> believes.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> Yet your grandeur is not delusional, <em>because</em> you did not make it.\n<em>You</em> have made grandiosity and are afraid of it because it is a form of\nattack, but your grandeur is of God, Who created it out of His Love.\nFrom your grandeur you can only bless, because your grandeur is your\n<em>abundance</em>. By blessing, you hold it in your mind, protecting it from\nillusions and keeping yourself in the Mind of God. Remember always that\nyou cannot be anywhere <em>except</em> in the Mind of God. When you forget\nthis, you <em>will</em> despair, and you <em>will</em> attack.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> The ego depends <em>solely</em> on your willingness to tolerate it. If you\nare willing to look upon your grandeur, you <em>cannot</em> despair, and\ntherefore you cannot <em>want</em> the ego. Your grandeur is God’s <em>answer</em> to\nthe ego because it is true. Littleness and grandeur cannot co-exist, nor\nis it possible for them to alternate in your awareness. Littleness and\ngrandiosity can and <em>must</em> alternate in your awareness since both are\nuntrue and are therefore on the same level. Being the level of shift, it\nis experienced as shifting, and extremes are its essential\ncharacteristic.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> Truth and littleness are <em>denials</em> of each other, because grandeur\n<em>is</em> truth. Truth does not vacillate; it is <em>always</em> true. When grandeur\nslips away from you, you have replaced it with something <em>you</em> have\nmade. Perhaps it is the belief in littleness; perhaps it is the belief\nin grandiosity. Yet it <em>must</em> be insane because it is <em>not</em> true. Your\ngrandeur will <em>never</em> deceive you, but your illusions <em>always</em> will.\nIllusions <em>are</em> deceptions. You cannot triumph, but you <em>are</em> exalted.\nAnd in your exalted state, you seek others like you and rejoice with\nthem.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> It is easy to distinguish grandeur from grandiosity because love is\nreturned, but pride is not. Pride will not produce miracles and\ntherefore will deprive you of your true witnesses to your reality. Truth\nis not obscure nor hidden, but its obviousness to <em>you</em> lies in the joy\nyou bring to its witnesses, who <em>show</em> it to you. They attest to your\ngrandeur, but they cannot attest to pride, because pride is not shared.\nGod <em>wants</em> you to behold what He created, because it is His joy.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Can your grandeur be arrogant when God Himself witnesses to it? And\nwhat can be real that <em>has</em> no witnesses? What good can come of it? And\nif no good can come of it, the Holy Spirit cannot use it. What He cannot\ntransform to the Will of God does not exist at all. Grandiosity is\ndelusional, because it is used to <em>replace</em> your grandeur. Yet what God\nhas created cannot <em>be</em> replaced. God is incomplete without you, because\nHis grandeur is total, and you cannot <em>be</em> missing from it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> You are altogether irreplaceable in the Mind of God. No one else can\nfill your part of it, and while you leave your part of it empty, your\neternal place merely waits for your return. God, through His Voice,\nreminds you of it, and God Himself keeps your extensions safe within it.\nYet you do not know them until you return to them. You <em>cannot</em> replace\nthe Kingdom, and you cannot replace <em>yourself.</em> God, Who <em>knows</em> your\nvalue, would not have it so, and so it is <em>not</em> so. Your value is in\n<em>God’s</em> Mind and therefore not in yours alone. To accept yourself as God\ncreated you cannot be arrogance, because it is the <em>denial</em> of\narrogance. To accept your littleness <em>is</em> arrogant, because it means\nthat you believe <em>your</em> evaluation of yourself is <em>truer</em> than God’s.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> Yet if truth is indivisible, your evaluation of yourself must <em>be</em>\nGod’s. You did not establish your value, and it <em>needs</em> no defense.\nNothing can attack it or prevail over it. It does not vary. It merely\n<em>is</em>. Ask the Holy Spirit <em>what</em> it is and He will tell you, but do not\nbe afraid of His answer, for it comes from God. It <em>is</em> an exalted\nanswer because of its Source, but the Source is true and so is Its\nanswer. Listen and do not question what you hear, for God does not\ndeceive. He would have you replace the ego’s belief in littleness with\nHis own exalted answer to the question of your being, so that you can\ncease to question it and <em>know</em> it for what it <em>is</em>.</p>\n\n",

That is <em>why</em> your\nwill is holy. Can anything exceed the love of God? Can anything, then,\nexceed <em>your</em> will? Nothing can reach you from beyond it because, being\nin God, <em>you</em> encompass everything. Believe this, and you <em>will</em> realize\nhow much is up to you.

But remember that it is <em>as impossible\nfor God</em>. The law of creation is that you love your creations as\nyourself because they <em>are</em> part of you. Everything that was created is\ntherefore perfectly safe, because the laws of God protect it by His\nLove. Any part of your mind that does not know this has banished itself\nfrom knowledge because it has not met its conditions.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> Who could have done this but you? Recognize this gladly, for in this\nrecognition lies the realization that your banishment is <em>not</em> of God\nand therefore does not exist. You are at home in God, dreaming of exile\nbut perfectly capable of awakening to reality. Is it your will to do so?\nYou know from your own experience that what you see in dreams you think\nis real as long as you are asleep. Yet the instant you waken, you <em>know</em>\nthat everything that <em>seemed</em> to happen did not happen at all. You do\nnot think this mysterious, even though all the laws of what you awakened\n<em>to</em> were violated while you slept.

You do not remember being awake. When you hear the\nHoly Spirit, you merely feel better because loving seems <em>possible</em> to\nyou, but you do <em>not</em> remember yet that it once was so. And it is in\nthis remembering that you will know it can be so again. What is possible\nhas not yet been accomplished. Yet what has once been is so <em>now</em> if it\nis eternal.

And you have <em>replaced</em>\nyour knowledge by an awareness of dreams because you are <em>afraid</em> of\nyour dissociation, <em>not</em> of what you have dissociated. Even in this\nworld’s therapy, when dissociated material is <em>accepted</em>, it ceases to\nbe fearful, for the laws of mind always hold.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> Yet to give up the dissociation of <em>reality</em> brings more than merely\nlack of fear.

But signify your will to remember Him and behold! He will\ngive you everything but for the asking.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> When you attack, you are denying <em>yourself.</em> You are specifically\nteaching yourself that you are <em>not</em> what you are. Your denial of\nreality precludes the <em>acceptance</em> of God’s gift, because you have\naccepted something <em>else</em> in its place. If you understand that the\nmisuse of defenses always constitutes an attack on truth and truth is\nGod, you will realize why this is <em>always</em> fearful.

It cannot <em>be</em> anything else. Arising\nfrom your <em>own</em> decision <em>not</em> to be what you <em>are, it is an attack on\nyour identification</em>. Attack is thus the way in which your\nidentification is lost because, when you attack, you <em>must</em> have\nforgotten what you are. And if your reality is God’s, when <em>you</em> attack\nyou are not remembering <em>Him</em>. This is not because He is gone, but\nbecause you are willing <em>actively not to remember Him</em>.]</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> If you realized the complete havoc this makes of your peace of mind,\nyou could not make such an insane decision. You make it only because you\nstill believe that it can <em>get</em> you something you <em>want.</em> It follows,\nthen, that you want something <em>other</em> than peace of mind, but you have\nnot considered what it must be. Yet the logical outcome of your decision\nis perfectly clear if you will <em>look</em> at it. By deciding <em>against</em> your\nreality, you have made yourself vigilant <em>against</em> God and His Kingdom.\nAnd it is <em>this</em> vigilance that makes you afraid to remember Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> You have <em>not</em> attacked God, and you <em>do</em> love Him. Can you change\nyour reality? No one can will to destroy himself. When you think you are\nattacking yourself, it is a sure sign that you hate what you <em>think</em> you\nare. And this, and <em>only</em> this, can <em>be</em> attacked by you. What you\n<em>think</em> you are can be hateful, and what this strange image makes you do\ncan be very destructive. Yet the destruction is no more real than the\nimage, although those who make idols <em>do</em> worship them. The idols are\nnothing, but their worshipers are the Sons of God in sickness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> God would have them released from their sickness and returned to His\nMind. He will not <em>limit</em> your power to help them, because He has\n<em>given</em> it to you. Do not be afraid of it, because it is your salvation.\nWhat Comforter can there be for the sick Children of God except His\npower through <em>you</em>? Remember that it does not matter <em>where</em> in the\nSonship He is accepted. He is <em>always</em> accepted for all, and when <em>your</em>\nmind receives Him, the remembrance of Him awakens throughout the\nSonship. Heal your brothers simply by accepting God <em>for</em> them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> Your minds are not separate, and God has only one channel for\nhealing, because He has but one Son. His remaining communication link\nwith all His Children joins them together and them to Him. To be aware\nof this is to heal them, because it is the awareness that no one is\nseparate, and so no one is sick. To believe that a Son of God <em>can</em> be\nsick is to believe that part of God can suffer. Love <em>cannot</em> suffer,\nbecause it cannot attack. The remembrance of love therefore brings\ninvulnerability with it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> Do not side with sickness in the presence of a Son of God even if\n<em>he</em> believes in it, for <em>your</em> acceptance of God in him <em>acknowledges</em>\nthe love of God which he has forgotten. Your recognition of him as\n<em>part</em> of God teaches him the truth about himself, which he is denying.\nWould you <em>strengthen</em> his denial of God and thus lose sight of\n<em>yourself</em>? Or would you remind him of his wholeness and remember your\nCreator <em>with</em> him? To believe a Son of God is sick is to worship the\nsame idol he does. God created love, <em>not</em> idolatry. All forms of\nidolatry are caricatures of creation, taught by sick minds which are too\ndivided to know that creation <em>shares</em> power and <em>never</em> usurps it.\nSickness is idolatry, because it is the belief that power can be taken\n<em>from</em> you. Yet this is impossible, because you are part of God, Who\n<em>is</em> all power.</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> A sick god <em>must</em> be an idol, made in the image of what its maker\nthinks <em>he</em> is. And that is exactly what the ego <em>does</em> perceive in a\nSon of God; a sick god, self-created, self-sufficient, very vicious, and\nvery vulnerable. Is <em>this</em> the idol you would worship? Is <em>this</em> the\nimage you would be vigilant to <em>save</em>? [Are you <em>really</em> afraid of\nlosing <em>this</em>?] Look calmly at the logical conclusion of the ego’s\nthought system and judge whether its offering is really what you want,\nfor this <em>is</em> what it offers you. To <em>obtain</em> this you are willing to\nattack the divinity of your brothers and thus lose sight of <em>yours</em>. And\nyou are willing to keep it hidden and to protect this idol, which you\nthink will save you from the dangers which the idol itself <em>stands for</em>,\nbut which do not exist.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> There are no idolaters in the Kingdom, but there is great\nappreciation for every Soul which God created because of the calm\nknowledge that each one is part of Him. God’s Son knows no idols, but he\n<em>does</em> know his Father. Health in this world is the counterpart of value\nin Heaven. It is not my merit that I contribute to you but my love, for\nyou do not value yourselves. When you do not value yourself, you become\nsick, but <em>my</em> value of you can heal you because the value of God’s Son\nis one. When I said, “My peace I give unto you,” I meant it. Peace came\nfrom God through me to <em>you</em>. It was for you, although you did not ask.</p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> When a brother is sick, it is because he is <em>not</em> asking for peace\nand therefore does not know he <em>has</em> it. The <em>acceptance</em> of peace is\nthe denial of illusion, and sickness <em>is</em> an illusion. Yet every Son of\nGod has the power to deny illusions <em>anywhere</em> in the Kingdom merely by\ndenying them completely in himself. <em>I</em> can heal you because I <em>know</em>\nyou. I know your value <em>for</em> you, and it is this value that makes you\nwhole. A whole mind is not idolatrous and does not know of conflicting\nlaws. I will heal you merely because I have only <em>one</em> message, and it\nis true. Your faith in it will make you whole when you have faith in me.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> I do not bring God’s message with deception, and you will learn this\nas you learn that you always receive as much as you <em>accept.</em> You could\naccept peace <em>now</em> for everyone you meet and offer them perfect freedom\nfrom <em>all</em> illusions because <em>you</em> heard. But have no other gods before\nHim, or you will <em>not</em> hear. God is not jealous of the gods you make,\nbut <em>you</em> are. You would save them and serve them, because you believe\nthat they made <em>you</em>. You think they are your father because you are\nprojecting onto them the fearful fact that <em>you</em> made them to <em>replace</em>\nGod. Yet when they seem to speak to you, remember that nothing <em>can</em>\nreplace God, and whatever replacements you have attempted <em>are</em> nothing.</p>\n\n<p><sup>82</sup> Very simply, then, you may <em>believe</em> you are afraid of nothingness,\nbut you are really afraid of <em>nothing</em>. And in <em>that</em> awareness you are\nhealed. You <em>will</em> hear the god you listen to. You <em>made</em> the god of\nsickness, and <em>by</em> making him, you made yourself able to hear him. Yet\nyou did not create him, because he is <em>not</em> the Will of the Father. He\nis therefore not eternal and will be <em>unmade</em> for you the instant you\nsignify your willingness to accept <em>only</em> the eternal. If God has but\none Son, there is but one God. You share reality with Him, <em>because</em>\nreality is not divided. To accept other gods before Him is to place\nother images before <em>yourself</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> You do not realize how much you listen to your gods and how vigilant\nyou are on their behalf. Yet they exist only <em>because</em> you honor them.\nPlace honor where it is due, and peace will be yours. It is your\ninheritance from your <em>real</em> Father. You cannot make your father, and\nthe father you made did not make you. Honor is not due to illusions, for\nto honor them is to honor nothing. Yet fear is not due them either, for\nnothing cannot be fearful. You have chosen to fear love <em>because</em> of its\nperfect harmlessness, and because of this fear, you have been willing to\ngive up your own perfect helpfulness and your own perfect Help.</p>\n\n<p><sup>84</sup> Only at the altar of God will you find peace. And this altar is in\nyou, because God put it there. His Voice still calls you to return, and\nHe will be heard when you place no other gods before Him. You can give\nup the god of sickness for your brothers; in fact, you would <em>have</em> to\ndo so if you give him up for yourself. For if you see him anywhere, you\nhave accepted him. And if you accept him, you <em>will</em> bow down and\nworship him because he was made as God’s replacement. He is the belief\nthat you can <em>choose</em> which god is real. Although it is perfectly clear\nthat this has nothing to do with reality, it is equally clear that it\nhas <em>everything</em> to do with reality as you perceive it.</p>",

    "content": "<p><sup>85</sup> <em>All</em> magic is a form of reconciling the irreconcilable. All religion\nis the recognition that the irreconcilable cannot <em>be</em> reconciled.\nSickness and perfection <em>are</em> irreconcilable. If God created you\nperfect, you <em>are</em> perfect. If you believe you can be sick, you have\nplaced other gods before Him. God is not at war with the god of sickness\nyou made, but <em>you</em> are. He is the symbol of willing <em>against</em> God, and\nyou are afraid of him, <em>because</em> he cannot be reconciled with God’s\nWill. If you attack him, you will make him real to you. But if you\nrefuse to worship him in whatever form he may appear to you and wherever\nyou think you see him, he will disappear into the nothingness out of\nwhich he was made.</p>\n\n<p><sup>86</sup> Reality can dawn only on an unclouded mind. It is always there to be\naccepted, but its acceptance depends on your willingness to <em>have</em> it.\nTo know reality must involve the willingness to judge <em>unreality</em> for\nwhat it is. This is the <em>right</em> use of selective perception. To overlook\nnothingness is merely to judge it correctly, and because of your ability\nto evaluate it truly, <em>to let it go</em>. Knowledge cannot dawn on a mind\nfull of illusions because truth and illusions are irreconcilable. Truth\nis whole and <em>cannot</em> be known by part of a mind.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> The Sonship cannot be perceived as <em>partly</em> sick, because to perceive\nit that way is not to perceive it at all. If the Sonship is one, it is\none in <em>all</em> respects. Oneness <em>cannot</em> be divided. If you perceive\nother gods, your mind is split, and you will not be able to <em>limit</em> the\nsplit because the split <em>is</em> the sign that you have removed part of your\nmind from God’s Will, and this means it is out of control. To be out of\ncontrol is to be out of <em>reason</em>, and the mind <em>does</em> become\nunreasonable without reason. This is merely a matter of definition. By\n<em>defining</em> the mind wrongly, you perceive it as <em>functioning</em> wrongly.</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> God’s laws will keep your minds at peace, because peace is His Will,\nand His laws are established to uphold it. His are the laws of freedom,\nbut yours are the laws of bondage. Since freedom and bondage are\nirreconcilable, their laws cannot <em>be</em> understood together. The laws of\nGod work only for your good, and there <em>are</em> no other laws beside His.\nEverything else is merely lawless and therefore chaotic. Yet God Himself\nhas protected everything He created <em>by</em> His laws. Therefore, everything\nthat is not under them does not exist. “Laws of chaos” are meaningless\nby definition. Creation is perfectly lawful, and the chaotic is without\nmeaning because it is without <em>God</em>. You have given your peace to the\ngods you made, but they are not there to take it from you, and you are\nnot able to give it to them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>89</sup> You are <em>not</em> free to give up freedom, but only to <em>deny</em> it. You\n<em>cannot</em> do what God did not intend, because what He did not intend\n<em>does not happen.</em> Your gods do not <em>bring</em> chaos; you are <em>endowing</em>\nthem with chaos and accepting it of them. All this has never been.\nNothing but the laws of God has ever operated, and nothing except His\nWill will ever be. You were created through His laws and by His Will,\nand the manner of your creation established you <em>as</em> creators. What you\nhave made is so unworthy of you that you could hardly want it if you\nwere willing to see it <em>as it is</em>. You will see nothing at all. And your\nvision will automatically look beyond it to what is in you and all\naround you. Reality cannot break through the obstructions you interpose,\nbut it <em>will</em> envelop you completely when you let them go.</p>\n\n<p><sup>90</sup> When you have experienced the protection of God, the making of idols\nbecomes inconceivable. There are no strange images in the Mind of God,\nand what is not in His Mind cannot be in yours because you are of <em>One</em>\nMind and that Mind belongs to <em>Him</em>. It is yours, <em>because</em> it belongs\nto Him, for ownership is sharing to Him. And if it is so for Him, it is\nso for you. His definitions <em>are</em> His laws, for by them He established\nthe universe as what it is. No false gods you attempt to interpose\nbetween yourself and your reality affect truth at all. Peace is yours\nbecause God created you. And He created nothing else.</p>\n\n<p><sup>91</sup> The miracle is the act of a Son of God who has laid aside all false\ngods and who calls on his brothers to do likewise. It is an act of\nfaith, because it is the recognition that his brother can do it. It is a\ncall to the Holy Spirit in his mind, a call to Him which is strengthened\nby this joining. Because the miracle worker has heard Him, he\nstrengthens His Voice in a sick brother by weakening his <em>belief</em> in\nsickness, which he does <em>not</em> share. The power of one mind <em>can</em> shine\ninto another, because all the lamps of God were lit by the same spark.\nIt is everywhere, and it is eternal.</p>\n\n<p><sup>92</sup> In many only the spark remains, for the Great Rays are obscured. Yet\nGod has kept the spark alive so that the rays can never be completely\nforgotten. If you but see the little spark, you will learn of the\ngreater light, for the rays are there unseen. Perceiving the spark will\nheal, but knowing the light will create. Yet in the returning, the\nlittle light must be acknowledged first, for the separation was a\ndescent from magnitude to littleness. But the spark is still as pure as\nthe great light, because it is the remaining call of creation. Put all\nyour faith in it, and God Himself will answer you.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>93</sup> The rituals of the god of sickness are strange and very demanding.\nJoy is never permitted, for depression is the sign of allegiance to him.\nDepression means that you have foresworn God. Men are afraid of\nblasphemy, but they do not know what it means. They do not realize that\nto deny God is to deny their <em>own</em> identity, and in this sense the wages\nof sin <em>is</em> death. The sense is very literal; denial of life perceives\nits opposite, as <em>all</em> forms of denial replace what <em>is</em> with what is\n<em>not.</em> No one can really do this, but that you can <em>think</em> you can and\nbelieve you <em>have</em> is beyond dispute.</p>\n\n<p><sup>94</sup> Do not forget, however, that to deny God will inevitably result in\nprojection, and you will believe that others, <em>and not yourself</em>, have\ndone this to you. You will receive the message you give, because it is\nthe message you <em>want</em>. You may believe that you judge your brothers by\nthe messages they give <em>you</em>, but <em>you</em> have judged <em>them</em> by the\nmessage you give to <em>them</em>. Do not attribute your denial of joy to them,\nor you cannot see the spark in them that could bring joy to <em>you.</em> It is\nthe <em>denial</em> of the spark that brings depression, and whenever you see\nyour brothers <em>without</em> it, you <em>are</em> denying God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>95</sup> Allegiance to the denial of God is the ego’s religion. The god of\nsickness obviously demands the denial of health, because health is in\ndirect opposition to its own survival. But consider what this means to\n<em>you. Unless</em> you are sick, you cannot keep the gods you made, for only\nin sickness could you possibly <em>want</em> them. Blasphemy, then, is\n<em>self</em>-destructive, <em>not</em> God-destructive. It means that you are\nwilling <em>not</em> to know yourself <em>in</em> <em>order</em> to be sick. This is the\noffering which your god demands because, having made him out of <em>your</em>\ninsanity, he is an insane idea. He has many forms, but although he may\nseem like many different things he is but one idea—the denial of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>96</sup> Sickness and death entered the Mind of God’s Son <em>against</em> His Will.\nThe “attack on God” made His Son think he was fatherless, and out of his\ndepression, he made the god of depression. This was his alternative to\njoy, because he would not accept the fact that, although he was a\ncreator, he had been created. Yet the Son <em>is</em> helpless without the\nFather, Who alone is his help. We said before that of yourselves you can\ndo nothing, but you are not <em>of</em> yourselves. If you were, what you have\nmade would be true, and you could <em>never</em> escape.</p>\n\n<p><sup>97</sup> It is <em>because</em> you did not make yourselves that you need be troubled\nby nothing. Your gods are nothing, because your Father did not create\nthem. You cannot make creators who are unlike your Creator any more than\nHe could have created a Son who was unlike Him. If creation is sharing,\nit cannot create what is unlike itself. It can share only what it <em>is</em>.\nDepression is isolation, and so it could not have <em>been</em> created.</p>\n\n<p><sup>98</sup> Son of God, you have not sinned, but you <em>have</em> been much mistaken.\nYet this can be corrected, and God will help you, <em>knowing</em> that you\ncould not sin against Him. You denied Him <em>because</em> you loved Him,\nknowing that if you <em>recognized</em> your love for Him, you <em>could</em> not deny\nHim. Your denial of Him therefore means that you love Him and that you\nknow <em>He</em> loves <em>you</em>. Remember that what you deny, you <em>must</em> have\nknown. And if you accept denial, you can accept its <em>undoing</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>99</sup> Your Father has not denied you. He does not retaliate, but He <em>does</em>\ncall to you to return. When you think He has not answered your call,\n<em>you</em> have not answered <em>His</em>. He calls to you from every part of the\nSonship because of His love for His Son. If you <em>hear</em> His message, He\nhas answered you, and you will learn of Him if you hear aright. The love\nof God is in everything He created, for His Son is everywhere. Look with\npeace upon your brothers, and God will come rushing into your heart in\ngratitude for your gift to Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>100</sup> Do not look to the god of sickness for healing but only to the God\nof love, for healing is the <em>acknowledgment</em> of Him. When you\nacknowledge Him, you will <em>know</em> that He has never ceased to acknowledge\n<em>you</em> and that in His acknowledgment of you lies your Being. You are not\nsick, and you cannot die. But you <em>can</em> confuse yourself with things\nthat do. Remember, though, that to do this <em>is</em> blasphemy, for it means\nthat you are looking without love on God and His creation, from which He\ncannot <em>be</em> separated. Only the eternal can be loved, for love does not\ndie. What is of God is His forever, and you <em>are</em> of God. Would He allow\nHimself to suffer? And would He offer His Son anything that is not\nacceptable to Him?</p>\n\n<p><sup>101</sup> If you will accept yourself as God created you, you will be\nincapable of suffering. Yet to do this, you must acknowledge Him as your\nCreator. This is not because you will be punished otherwise. It is\nmerely because your acknowledgment of your Father <em>is</em> the\nacknowledgment of yourself as you are. Your Father created you wholly\nwithout sin, wholly without pain, and wholly without suffering of any\nkind. If you deny Him, you bring sin, pain, and suffering into your\n<em>own</em> mind because of the power He gave it. Your mind is capable of\ncreating worlds, but it can also deny what it creates because it is\nfree.</p>\n\n<p><sup>102</sup> You do not realize how much you have denied yourself, and how much\nGod in His love would not have it so. Yet He would not interfere with\nyou, because He would not know His Son if he were not free. To interfere\nwith you would be to attack Himself, and God is not insane. When you\ndenied Him, <em>you</em> were insane. Would you have Him <em>share</em> your insanity?\nGod will never cease to love His Son, and His Son will never cease to\nlove Him. That was the condition of His Son’s creation, fixed forever in\nthe Mind of God. To know that is sanity. To deny it is insanity. God\ngave Himself to you in your creation, and His gifts are eternal. Would\nyou deny yourself to Him?</p>\n\n<p><sup>103</sup> Out of your gifts to Him, the Kingdom will be restored to His Son.\nHis Son removed himself <em>from</em> His gift by refusing to accept what had\nbeen created for him and what he himself had created in the Name of his\nFather. Heaven waits for his return, for it was created as the dwelling\nplace of God’s Son. You are not at home anywhere else or in any other\ncondition. Do not deny yourself the joy which was created for you for\nthe misery you have made for yourselves. God has given you the means for\nundoing what you have made. Listen, and you <em>will</em> learn what you are.</p>\n\n<p><sup>104</sup> If God knows His Children as wholly sinless, it is blasphemous to\nperceive them as guilty. If God knows His Children as wholly without\npain, it is blasphemous to perceive suffering anywhere. If God knows His\nChildren to be wholly joyous, it is blasphemous to feel depressed. All\nof these illusions and the many other forms which blasphemy may take are\n<em>refusals</em> to accept creation as it is. If God created His Son perfect,\nthat is how you must learn to see him to learn of his reality. And as\n<em>part</em> of the Sonship, that is how you must see <em>yourself</em> to learn of\n<em>yours.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>105</sup> Do not perceive <em>anything</em> God did not create, or you are denying\n<em>Him</em>. His is the <em>only</em> Fatherhood, and it is yours only because <em>He</em>\nhas given it to you. Your gifts to yourself are meaningless, but your\ngifts to <em>your</em> creations are like His because they are given in His\nName. That is why your creations are as real as His. Yet the real\nFatherhood must be acknowledged if the real Son is to be known. You\nbelieve that the sick things which you have made are your real\ncreations, because you believe that the sick images you perceive <em>are</em>\nthe Sons of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>106</sup> Only if you accept the Fatherhood of God will you have <em>anything</em>,\nbecause His fatherhood <em>gave</em> you everything. That is why to deny Him\n<em>is</em> to deny yourself. Arrogance is the denial of love, because love\n<em>shares</em> and arrogance <em>withholds</em>. As long as both appear to you to be\ndesirable, the concept of choice, which is <em>not</em> of God, will remain\nwith you. While this is not true in eternity, it <em>is</em> true in time, so\nthat while time lasts in <em>your</em> minds, there <em>will</em> be choices. Time\n<em>itself</em> was your choice.</p>\n\n<p><sup>107</sup> If you would remember eternity, you must learn to look <em>only</em> on the\neternal. If you allow yourselves to become preoccupied with the\ntemporal, you <em>are</em> living in time. As always, your choice is determined\nby what you value. Time and eternity cannot both be real, because they\ncontradict each other. If you will accept only what is timeless as real,\nyou will begin to understand eternity and make it yours.</p>\n\n",

The more you approach the\ncenter of His thought system, the clearer the light becomes. The closer\nyou come to [the foundation of] the ego’s thought system, the darker\nand more obscure becomes the way. Yet even the little spark in your mind\nis enough to lighten it. Bring this light fearlessly with you and hold\nit up to the foundation of the ego’s thought system bravely. Be willing\nto judge it with perfect honesty. Open the dark cornerstone of terror on\nwhich it rests and bring it out into the light. There you will see that\nit rests on meaninglessness and that everything of which you have been\nafraid was based on nothing.</p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup> My brother, you are part of God and part of me. When you have at last\nlooked at the ego’s foundation without shrinking, you will also have\nlooked upon <em>ours</em>. I come to you from our Father to offer you\neverything again. Do not refuse it in order to keep a dark cornerstone\nhidden, for <em>its</em> protection will not save you. I <em>give</em> you the lamp\nand I will go <em>with</em> you. You will not take this journey alone. I will\nlead you to your true Father, Who hath need of you as I have. Will you\nnot answer the call of love with joy?</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> You have learned your need of healing. Would you bring anything <em>else</em>\nto the Sonship, recognizing your need of healing for yourself? For in\nthis lies the beginning of knowledge, the foundation on which God will\nhelp you build again the thought system which you share with <em>Him</em>. Not\none stone you place upon it but will be blessed by Him, for you will be\nrestoring the holy dwelling place of His Son, where He wills His Son to\nbe and where he <em>is</em>. In whatever part of the Mind of God’s Son you\nrestore this reality, you restore it to <em>yourself</em>. For you dwell in the\nMind of God <em>with</em> your brother, for God Himself did not will to be\nalone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> To be alone is to be separated from infinity, but how can this be if\ninfinity has no end? No one can be <em>beyond</em> the limitless because what\nhas no limits must be everywhere. There are no beginnings and no endings\nin God, Whose universe is Himself. Can you exclude yourself from the\nuniverse or from God, Who <em>is</em> the universe? I and my Father are one\nwith <em>you</em>, for you are part of <em>us</em>. Do you really believe that part of\nGod can be missing or lost to Him?</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> If you were not part of God, His Will would not be unified. Is this\nconceivable? Can part of His Mind contain nothing? If your place in His\nMind cannot be filled by anyone <em>except</em> you, and your filling it <em>was</em>\nyour creation, <em>without</em> you there would be an empty place in God’s\nMind. Extension cannot be blocked, and it <em>has</em> no voids. It continues\nforever, however much it is denied. Your denial of its reality arrests\nit in time but <em>not</em> in eternity. That is why your creations have not\nceased to be extended and why so much is waiting for your return.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> Waiting is possible <em>only</em> in time, but time has no meaning. You who\nmade delay can leave time behind simply by recognizing that neither\nbeginnings nor endings were created by the Eternal, Who placed no limits\non His creation nor upon those who create like Him. You do not know this\nsimply because you have tried to limit what <em>He</em> created, and so you\nbelieve that <em>all</em> creation is limited. How, then, could you know your\ncreations, having <em>denied</em> infinity? The laws of the universe do not\npermit contradiction. What holds for God holds for <em>you</em>. If you believe\n<em>you</em> are absent from God, you <em>will</em> believe that He is absent from\n<em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> Infinity is meaningless <em>without</em> you, and <em>you</em> are meaningless\nwithout God. There <em>is</em> no end to God and His Son, for we <em>are</em> the\nuniverse. God is not incomplete, and He is not childless. Because He did\nnot will to be alone, He created a Son like Himself. Do not deny Him His\nSon, for your unwillingness to accept His Fatherhood has denied you\n<em>yours</em>. See His creations as <em>His</em> Son, for yours were created in honor\nof Him. The universe of love does not stop because you do not see it,\nand your closed eyes have not lost the ability to see. Look upon the\nglory of His creation, and you will learn what God has <em>kept</em> for you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> God has given you a place in His Mind which is yours forever. Yet you\ncould keep it only by <em>giving</em> it, as it was given <em>you.</em> Could <em>you</em> be\nalone there if it was given you because God did not will to be alone?\nGod’s Mind cannot <em>be</em> lessened. It can <em>only</em> be increased, and\neverything He creates has the function of creating. Love does not limit,\nand what it creates is not limited. To give without limit is God’s Will\nfor you because only this can bring you the joy which is His and which\nHe wills to <em>share</em> with you. Your love is as boundless as His because\nit <em>is</em> His.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> Could any part of God be <em>without</em> His love and could any part of His\nlove be contained? God is your heritage because His one gift is Himself.\nHow can you give except like Him if you would know His gift to <em>you</em>?\nGive, then, without limit and without end to learn how much <em>He</em> has\ngiven <em>you</em>. Your ability to <em>accept</em> Him depends on your willingness to\ngive as He gives. Your fatherhood and your Father <em>are</em> one. God willed\nto create, and your will is His. It follows, then, that <em>you</em> will to\ncreate since your will follows from His. And being an extension of His\nWill, yours must be the same.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> Yet what you will you do not know. This is not strange when you\nrealize that to deny is to “<em>not</em> know.” God’s Will is that you are His\nSon. By denying this, you denied your <em>own</em> will and therefore do <em>not</em>\nknow what it is. The reason you must ask what God’s Will is in\neverything is merely because it <em>is</em> yours. You do not know what it is,\nbut the Holy Spirit remembers it <em>for</em> you. Ask Him, therefore, what\nGod’s Will is for you, and He will tell you <em>yours.</em> It cannot be too\noften repeated that you do <em>not</em> know it. Whenever what the Holy Spirit\ntells you appears to be coercive, it is only because you do not\n<em>recognize</em> your own will.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> The projection of the ego makes it appear as if God’s Will is\n<em>outside</em> yourself and therefore <em>not</em> yours. In this interpretation, it\n<em>is</em> possible for God’s Will and yours to conflict. God then may <em>seem</em>\nto demand of you what you do not want to give and thus deprive you of\nwhat you want. Would God, who wants <em>only</em> your will, be capable of\nthis? Your will is His Life, which He has given to you. Even in time you\ncannot live apart from Him, for sleep is not death. What He created can\nsleep, but it <em>cannot</em> die. Immortality is His Will for His Son and His\nSon’s will for <em>himself</em>. God’s Son cannot will death for himself\nbecause His Father is Life and His Son is like Him. Creation is your\nwill <em>because</em> it is His.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> You cannot be happy unless you do what you will truly, and you cannot\nchange this because it is immutable. It is immutable by God’s Will <em>and\nyours</em>, for otherwise His Will would not have been extended. You are\nafraid to know God’s Will because you believe it is <em>not</em> yours. This\nbelief is your whole sickness and your whole fear. Every symptom of\nsickness and fear arises here because this is the belief that makes you\n<em>want</em> not to know. Believing this, you hide in darkness, denying that\nthe light is in you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> You are asked to trust the Holy Spirit only because He speaks for\n<em>you</em>. He is the Voice for God, but never forget that God did not will\nto be alone. He <em>shares</em> His Will with you; He does not thrust it <em>upon</em>\nyou.

Every attack is a\nstep away from this, and every healing thought brings it closer. The Son\nof God <em>has</em> both Father and Son because he <em>is</em> both Father and Son. To\nunite having and being is only to unite your will with His, for He wills\nyou Himself. And you will yourself to Him because, in your perfect\nunderstanding of Him, you <em>know</em> there is but one will. Yet when you\nattack any part of God and His Kingdom, your understanding is not\nperfect, and what you will is therefore lost to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> Healing thus becomes a lesson in <em>understanding</em>, and the more you\npractice it, the better teacher <em>and learner</em> you become. If you have\ndenied truth, what better witnesses to its reality could you have than\nthose who have been healed by it? But be sure to count yourself among\nthem, for in your willingness to join them is <em>your</em> healing\naccomplished. Every miracle which you accomplish speaks to you of the\nFatherhood of God. Every healing thought which you accept, either from\nyour brother or in your own mind, teaches you that you are God’s Son. In\nevery hurtful thought you hold, wherever you perceive it, lies the\ndenial of God’s Fatherhood and your Sonship.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> And denial is as total as love. You cannot deny part of yourself\nbecause the remainder will seem to be unintegrated and therefore without\nmeaning. And being without meaning to you, you will not understand it.\nTo deny meaning <em>must</em> be to fail to understand. You can heal only\nyourself, for only God’s Son <em>needs</em> healing. He needs it because he\ndoes not understand himself and therefore knows not what he does. Having\nforgotten his will, he does not know what he wants.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> Healing is a sign that he wants <em>to make whole</em>. And this willingness\nopens his <em>own</em> ears to the Voice of the Holy Spirit, whose message <em>is</em>\nwholeness. He will enable you to go far beyond the healing <em>you</em> would\nundertake, for beside your small willingness to make whole, He will lay\nHis own <em>complete</em> will and make <em>yours</em> whole. What can the Son of God\n<em>not</em> accomplish with the Fatherhood of God in him? And yet the\ninvitation must come from you, for you have surely learned that whom you\ninvite as your guest <em>will</em> abide with you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> The Holy Spirit cannot speak to an unwelcoming host because He will\n<em>not be heard</em>. The Eternal Guest remains, but His Voice grows faint in\nalien company. He needs your protection, but only because your care is a\nsign that you <em>want</em> Him. Think like Him ever so slightly, and the\nlittle spark becomes a blazing light that fills your mind so that He\nbecomes your <em>only</em> Guest. Whenever you ask the ego to enter, you lessen\nHis welcome. He will remain, but <em>you</em> have allied yourself <em>against</em>\nHim. Whatever journey you choose to take, He will go with you, waiting.\nYou can safely trust His patience, for He cannot leave a part of God.\nYet you need far more than patience.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> You will never rest until you know your function <em>and</em> <em>fulfill it</em>,\nfor only in this can your will and your Father’s be wholly joined. To\n<em>have</em> Him is to be <em>like</em> Him, and He has given Himself to you. You who\nhave God <em>must</em> be as God, for <em>His</em> function became <em>yours</em> with His\ngift. Invite this knowledge back into your minds, and let nothing that\nwill obscure it enter. The Guest whom God sent you will teach you how to\ndo this if you but recognize the little spark and are willing to <em>let it\ngrow.</em> <em>Your</em> willingness need not be perfect, because His <em>is</em>. If you\nwill merely offer Him a little place, He will lighten it so much that\nyou will gladly extend it. And by <em>this</em> extending, you will begin to\nremember creation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> Would you be hostage to the ego or host to God? You will accept only\nwhom <em>you</em> invite. You are free to determine who shall be your guest and\nhow long he shall remain with you. Yet this is not <em>real</em> freedom, for\nit still depends on how you see it. The Holy Spirit is <em>there</em>, although\nHe cannot help you without your invitation, and the ego is nothing\nwhether you invite it in or not. Real freedom depends on welcoming\n<em>reality</em>, and of your guests, only He is real. Know, then, who abides\nwith you merely by recognizing what is there <em>already</em> and do not be\nsatisfied with imaginary comforters, for the Comforter of God is in you.</p>\n\n",

You do not know <em>how</em>, for if you did\nyou could never have grown weary. Unless you have hurt yourselves, you\ncould never suffer in <em>any</em> way, for that is not God’s Will for His Son.\nPain is not of Him, for He knows no attack and His peace surrounds you\nsilently. God is very quiet, for there is no conflict in Him. Conflict\nis the root of all evil, for being blind, it does not see whom it\nattacks. Yet it <em>always</em> attacks the Son of God, and the Son of God is\n<em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> God’s Son is indeed in need of comfort, for he knows not what he\ndoes, believing his will is not his own. The Kingdom is his, and yet he\nwanders homelessly. At home in God, he is lonely, and amid all his\nbrothers, he is friendless. Would God <em>let</em> this be real if He did not\nwill to be alone Himself? And if your will is His, it cannot be true of\nyou <em>because</em> it is not true of Him.

Out of your\njoy you will create beauty in His name, for <em>your</em> joy could no more be\ncontained than His. The bleak little world will vanish into nothingness,\nand your heart will be so filled with joy that it will leap into Heaven\nand into the Presence of God. I cannot tell you what this will be like,\nfor your hearts are not ready. Yet I <em>can</em> tell you and remind you often\nthat what God wills for Himself He wills for <em>you</em>, and what He wills\nfor you <em>is</em> yours.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> The way is not hard, but it <em>is</em> very different. Yours is the way of\npain, of which God knows nothing. <em>That</em> way is hard indeed and very\nlonely. Fear and grief are your guests, and they go with you and abide\nwith you on the way. But the dark journey is not the way of God’s Son.\nWalk in light, and do not see the dark companions, for they are not fit\ncompanions for the Son of God, who was created <em>of</em> light and <em>in</em>\nlight. The Great Light always surrounds you and shines out <em>from</em> you.\nHow can you see the dark companions in a light such as this? If you see\n<em>them</em>, it is only because you are <em>denying</em> the light. But deny <em>them</em>\ninstead, for the light is here, and the way is clear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> God hides nothing from His Son, even though His Son would hide\nhimself. Yet the Son of God cannot hide his glory, for God wills him to\nbe glorious and gave him the light that shines in him. You will never\nlose your way, for God leads you. When you wander, you but undertake a\njourney which is not real. The dark companions, the dark way, are all\nillusions. Turn toward the light, for the little spark in you is part of\na light so great that it can sweep you out of all darkness forever. For\nyour Father <em>is</em> your Creator, and you <em>are</em> like Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> The children of light cannot abide in darkness, for darkness is not\nin them. Do not be deceived by the dark comforters, and never let them\nenter the Mind of God’s Son, for they have no place in His temple. When\nyou are tempted to deny Him, remember that there <em>are</em> no other gods\nthat you can place before Him, and accept His Will for you in peace. For\nyou <em>cannot</em> accept it otherwise.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> Only God’s Comforter <em>can</em> comfort you. In the quiet of His temple,\nHe waits to give you the peace that is yours. <em>Give</em> His peace that you\nmay enter the temple and find it waiting for you. But be holy in the\nPresence of God, or you will not know that you are there. For what is\nunlike God cannot enter His Mind because it was not His Thought and\ntherefore does not belong to Him. And <em>your</em> minds must be as pure as\nHis if you would know what belongs to <em>you.</em> Guard carefully His temple,\nfor He Himself dwells there and abides in peace. You cannot enter God’s\nPresence with the dark companions beside you, but you also cannot enter\nalone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> <em>All</em> your brothers must enter <em>with</em> you, for until you have\naccepted them, <em>you</em> cannot enter. For you cannot understand Wholeness\nunless <em>you</em> are whole, and no part of the Son can be excluded if he\nwould know the Wholeness of his Father. In your mind, you can accept the\nwhole Sonship and bless it with the light your Father gave it. Then you\nwill be worthy to dwell in the temple <em>with</em> Him because it is <em>your</em>\nwill not to be alone. God blessed His Son forever. If you will bless him\nin time, you will <em>be</em> in eternity. Time cannot separate you from God if\nyou use it on <em>behalf</em> of the eternal.</p>\n\n",

Yet if you hate part of your own\nSoul, <em>all</em> your understanding is lost because you are looking on what\nGod created as <em>yourself</em> without love.

The beginning\nphases of this reversal are often quite painful for, as blame is\nwithdrawn from without, there is a strong tendency to harbor it within.\nIt is difficult at first to realize that this is <em>exactly</em> the same\nthing, for there <em>is</em> no distinction between within and without.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> If your brothers are part of you and you blame <em>them</em> for your\ndeprivation, you <em>are</em> blaming yourself. And you cannot blame yourself\n<em>without</em> blaming them. That is why blame must be undone, <em>not</em>\nre-allocated. Lay it to yourself and you cannot <em>know</em> yourself, for\n<em>only</em> the ego blames at all. Self-blame is therefore ego identification\nand as strong an ego defense as blaming others. <em>You cannot enter God’s\nPresence if you attack His Son</em>. When His Son lifts his voice in praise\nof his Creator, he <em>will</em> hear the Voice of his Father.

There is no need to shrink from\nillusions, for they cannot be dangerous. We are ready to look more\nclosely at the ego’s thought system because together we have the lamp\nthat will dispel it, and since you realize you do not <em>want</em> it, <em>you</em>\nmust be ready. Let us be very calm in doing this, for we are merely\nlooking honestly for truth. The “dynamics” of the ego will be our lesson\nfor a while, for we must look first at this to look beyond it since you\n<em>have</em> made it real. We will <em>undo</em> this error quietly together and then\nlook beyond it to truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> What is healing but the removal of all that <em>stands in the way</em> of\nknowledge? And how else can one dispel illusions <em>except</em> by looking at\nthem directly <em>without</em> protecting them? Be not afraid, therefore, for\nwhat you will be looking at <em>is</em> the source of fear, but you have surely\nlearned by now that <em>fear</em> is not real. We have accepted the fact\nalready that its <em>effects</em> can be dispelled merely by denying their\nreality. The next step is obviously to recognize that what has no\neffects <em>does not exist.</em> Laws do not operate in a vacuum, and what\nleads to nothing <em>has not happened</em>. If reality is recognized by its\n<em>extension</em>, what extends to nothing cannot <em>be</em> real.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> Do not be afraid, then, to look upon fear, for it cannot <em>be</em> seen.\nClarity undoes confusion by definition, and to look upon darkness\nthrough light <em>must</em> dispel it. Let us begin this lesson in “ego\ndynamics” by understanding that the term itself does not mean anything.\nIn fact, it contains exactly the contradiction in terms which <em>makes</em> it\nmeaningless. “Dynamics” implies the power to <em>do</em> something, and the\nwhole separation <em>fallacy</em> lies in the belief that the ego has the power\nto do <em>anything</em>. The ego is fearful to you <em>because</em> you believe this.\nYet the truth is very simple:</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> <em><strong>All power is of God</strong>. What is <strong>not</strong> of Him has no power\nto do <strong>anything.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> When we look at the ego, then, we are not considering dynamics but\ndelusions. We can surely regard a delusional system without fear, for it\ncannot have any effects if its source is not true. Fear becomes more\nobviously inappropriate if one recognizes the ego’s <em>goal</em>, which is so\nclearly senseless that any effort exerted on its behalf is <em>necessarily</em>\nexpended on nothing. The ego’s goal is quite explicitly ego <em>autonomy</em>.\nFrom the beginning, then, its <em>purpose</em> is to be separate, sufficient\nunto itself, and independent of any power <em>except</em> its own. This is\n<em>why</em> it is the symbol of separation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> Every idea has a purpose, and its purpose is always the natural\nextension of what it <em>is</em>. Everything that stems from the ego is the\nnatural outcome of its central belief, and the way to undo its <em>results</em>\nis merely to recognize that their <em>source</em> is not natural, being out of\naccord with your <em>true</em> nature. We once said that to will contrary to\nGod is wishful thinking and not real willing. His Will is one because\nthe extension of His Will cannot be unlike itself. The real conflict you\nexperience, then, is between the ego’s idle wishes and the Will of God,\nwhich you share. Can this <em>be</em> a real conflict?</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> Yours is the independence of creation, <em>not</em> of autonomy. Your whole\ncreative function lies in your complete <em>dependence</em> on God, Whose\nfunction He shares with <em>you</em>. By <em>His</em> Willingness to share it, He\nbecame as dependent on you as you are on <em>Him</em>. Do not ascribe the ego’s\narrogance to Him, Who wills not to be independent of <em>you.</em> He has\n<em>included</em> you in His Autonomy. Can <em>you</em> believe that autonomy is\nmeaningful <em>apart</em> from Him? The belief in <em>ego</em> autonomy is costing you\nthe knowledge of your dependence on God <em>in which your freedom lies</em>.\nThe ego sees <em>all</em> dependency as threatening and has twisted even your\nlonging for God into a means of establishing <em>itself</em>. But do not be\ndeceived by <em>its</em> interpretation of your conflict.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> The ego <em>always</em> attacks on behalf of separation. Believing it has\nthe power to do this, it does nothing else because its goal of autonomy\n<em>is</em> nothing else. The ego is totally confused about reality, but it\ndoes <em>not</em> lose sight of its goal. It is much more vigilant than <em>you</em>\nare because it is perfectly certain of its purpose. <em>You</em> are confused\nbecause you do <em>not</em> know <em>yours</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> What you must learn to recognize is that the <em>last</em> thing the ego\nwishes you to realize is that <em>you are afraid of it.</em> For if the ego\ngives rise to fear, it is <em>diminishing</em> your independence and\n<em>weakening</em> your power. Yet its one claim to your allegiance is that it\ncan <em>give</em> power to you. Without this belief, you would not listen to it\nat all. How, then, can its existence continue if you realize that, <em>by</em>\naccepting it, you <em>are</em> belittling yourself and <em>depriving</em> yourself of\npower?</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> The ego can and does allow you to regard yourself as supercilious,\nunbelieving, “light-hearted,” distant, emotionally shallow, callous,\nuninvolved, and even desperate, but <em>not really afraid. Minimizing</em> fear\nbut <em>not</em> its undoing is the ego’s constant effort and is indeed the\nskill at which it is very ingenious. How can it preach separation\n<em>without</em> upholding it through fear, and would you listen to it if you\nrecognized this <em>is</em> what it is doing?</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> <em>Your</em> recognition that whatever seems to separate you from God is\n<em>only</em> fear, regardless of the form it takes and quite apart from how\nthe <em>ego</em> wants you to experience it, is therefore the basic ego threat.\nIts dream of autonomy is shaken to its foundation by this awareness. For\nthough you may countenance a false idea of independence, you will <em>not</em>\naccept the cost of fear <em>if you recognize it</em>. Yet this <em>is</em> the cost,\nand the ego <em>cannot</em> minimize it. For if you overlook love, you are\noverlooking <em>yourself</em>, and you <em>must</em> fear unreality <em>because</em> you have\ndenied yourself. By believing that you have successfully <em>attacked</em>\ntruth, you are believing that attack has <em>power.</em> Very simply, then, you\nhave become afraid of <em>yourself</em>. And no one wills to learn what he\nbelieves would destroy him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> If the ego’s goal of autonomy could be accomplished, God’s purpose\ncould be defeated, and this <em>is</em> impossible. Only by learning what fear\n<em>is</em>, can you finally learn to distinguish the possible from the\nimpossible and the false from the true. According to the ego’s teaching,\n<em>its</em> goal can be accomplished, and God’s purpose can <em>not</em>. According\nto the Holy Spirit’s teaching, <em>only</em> God’s purpose is accomplishment,\nand it is <em>already</em> accomplished.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> God is as dependent on you as you are on Him because His autonomy\n<em>encompasses</em> yours and is therefore incomplete <em>without</em> it. You can\nonly establish your autonomy by identifying <em>with</em> Him and fulfilling\nyour function <em>as it exists in truth</em>. The ego believes that to\naccomplish <em>its</em> goal is happiness. But it is given <em>you</em> to know that\nGod’s function <em>is</em> yours and happiness cannot be found apart from your\n<em>joint</em> will. Recognize only that the ego’s goal, which you have pursued\nquite diligently, has [only] brought you <em>fear</em>, and it becomes\ndifficult to maintain that fear <em>is</em> happiness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> <em>Upheld</em> by fear, this <em>is</em> what the ego would have you believe. Yet\nGod’s Son is not insane and <em>cannot</em> believe it. Let him but <em>recognize</em>\nit, and he will <em>not</em> accept it. For only the insane would choose fear\n<em>in place</em> of love, and only the insane could believe that love can be\ngained by attack. But the sane know that only attack could produce\n<em>fear</em> from which the love of God completely protects them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> The ego analyzes; the Holy Spirit <em>accepts</em>. The appreciation of\nwholeness comes <em>only</em> through acceptance, for to analyze means to\nseparate out. The attempt to understand totality by breaking it up is\nclearly the characteristically contradictory approach of the ego to\neverything. Never forget that the ego believes that power,\nunderstanding, and <em>truth</em> lie in separation, and to <em>establish</em> this\nbelief it <em>must</em> attack. Unaware that the belief cannot <em>be</em> established\nand obsessed with the conviction that separation <em>is</em> salvation, the ego\nattacks everything it perceives by breaking it up into small and\ndisconnected parts without meaningful relationships and thus without\nmeaning. The ego will <em>always</em> substitute chaos for meaning, for if\nseparation is salvation, harmony is threat.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> The ego’s interpretation of the laws of perception are, and would\n<em>have</em> to be, the exact opposite of the Holy Spirit’s. The ego focuses\non <em>error</em> and overlooks <em>truth</em>. It makes real <em>every</em> mistake it\nperceives, and with characteristically circular reasoning concludes\nthat, <em>because</em> of the mistake, consistent truth must be meaningless.\nThe next step, then, is obvious. If consistent truth is meaningless,\n<em>inconsistency</em> must be true if truth has meaning. Holding error clearly\nin mind and protecting what it has made real, the ego proceeds to the\nnext step in its thought system—that error is real, and <em>truth is\nerror</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> The ego makes no attempt to understand this, and it is clearly <em>not</em>\nunderstandable, but the ego does make <em>every</em> attempt to <em>demonstrate\nit</em>, and this it does constantly. Analyzing to attack meaning, the ego\n<em>does</em> succeed in overlooking it and is left with a series of fragmented\nperceptions which it unifies on behalf of <em>itself.</em> This, then, becomes\nthe universe it perceives. And it is this universe which, in turn,\nbecomes its demonstration of its own reality.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Do not underestimate the appeal of the ego’s demonstrations to those\nwho would listen. Selective perception chooses its witnesses carefully,\nand its witnesses <em>are</em> consistent. The case for insanity <em>is</em> strong to\nthe insane. For reasoning ends at its beginning, and no thought system\ntranscends its source. Yet reasoning without meaning <em>cannot</em>\ndemonstrate anything, and those who are convinced by it <em>must</em> be\ndeluded. Can the ego teach truly when it <em>overlooks</em> truth? Can it\nperceive what it has <em>denied?</em> Its witnesses <em>do</em> attest to its denial\nbut hardly to what it has denied! The ego looks straight at the Father\nand does not see Him, for it has denied His Son.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> Would <em>you</em> remember the Father? Accept His Son, and you <em>will</em>\nremember Him. Nothing can demonstrate that His Son is unworthy, for\nnothing can prove that a lie is true. What you see of His Son through\nthe eyes of the ego is a demonstration that His Son does not exist, yet\nwhere the Son is, the Father <em>must</em> be. Accept what God does <em>not</em> deny,\nand <em>He</em> will demonstrate its truth. The witnesses for God stand in His\nlight and behold what <em>He</em> created. Their silence is the sign that they\nhave beheld God’s Son, and in the Presence of Christ they need\ndemonstrate nothing, for Christ speaks to them of Himself and of His\nFather. They are silent because Christ speaks to them, and it is His\nwords that <em>they</em> speak.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> Every brother you meet becomes a witness for Christ or for the ego,\ndepending on what you perceive in him. Everyone convinces you of what\nyou <em>want</em> to perceive and of the reality of the kingdom you have chosen\nfor your vigilance. Everything you perceive is a witness to the thought\nsystem you <em>want</em> to be true. Every brother has the power to release you\n<em>if you will to be free</em>. You cannot accept false witness of <em>him</em>\nunless you have evoked false witnesses <em>against</em> him. If <em>he</em> speaks not\nof Christ to you, <em>you</em> spoke not of Christ to him. You hear but your\n<em>own</em> voice, and if Christ speaks <em>through</em> you, <em>you</em> will hear Him.</p>\n\n",

In effect, then,\nwhat you believe, you <em>do</em> see. That is what I meant when I said,\n“Blessed are ye who have not seen and still believe,” for those who\nbelieve in the resurrection <em>will</em> see it. The resurrection is the\ncomplete triumph of Christ over the ego, not by attack but by\ntranscendence. For Christ <em>does</em> rise above the ego and all its works\nand ascends to the Father and <em>His</em> Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> Would you join in the resurrection or the crucifixion? Would you\ncondemn your brothers or free them? Would you transcend <em>your</em> prison\nand ascend to the Father? For these questions are all the same and are\nanswered together. There has been much confusion about what perception\nmeans because the same word is used both for awareness and for the\n<em>interpretation</em> of awareness. Yet you cannot <em>be</em> aware without\ninterpretation, and what you perceive <em>is</em> your interpretation. This\ncourse is perfectly clear. You do not see it clearly because you are\ninterpreting <em>against</em> it and therefore do not <em>believe</em> it. And if\nbelief determines perception, you do <em>not</em> perceive what it means and\ntherefore do not <em>accept</em> it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> Yet different experiences lead to different beliefs, [and with them,\ndifferent perceptions. For perceptions are learned with beliefs,] and\nexperience teaches. I am leading you to a new kind of experience, which\nyou will become less and less willing to deny. Learning of Christ is\neasy, for to perceive with Him involves no strain at all. <em>His</em>\nperceptions are your <em>natural</em> awareness, and it is only distortions\nwhich <em>you</em> introduce that tire you. Let the Christ in you interpret\n<em>for</em> you, and do not try to limit what you see by narrow little beliefs\nwhich are unworthy of God’s Son. For until Christ comes into His own,\nthe Son of God <em>will</em> see himself as fatherless.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> I am <em>your</em> resurrection and <em>your</em> life. You live in me because you\nlive in God. And everyone lives in <em>you</em>, as <em>you</em> live in everyone. Can\nyou, then, perceive unworthiness in a brother and <em>not</em> perceive it in\nyourself? And can you perceive it in yourself and <em>not</em> perceive it in\nGod? Believe in the resurrection because it has <em>been</em> accomplished, and\nit has been accomplished <em>in you</em>. This is as true now as it will ever\nbe, for the resurrection is the Will of God, which knows no time and no\nexceptions. But make no exceptions yourself, or you will not perceive\nwhat has been accomplished <em>for</em> you. For we ascend unto the Father\ntogether, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, for\nsuch is the nature of God’s Son as His Father created him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> Do not underestimate the power of the devotion of God’s Son nor the\npower of the god he worships over him. For he places <em>himself</em> at the\naltar of his god, whether it be the god he made or the God who created\nhim. That is why his slavery is as complete as his freedom, for he will\nobey <em>only</em> the god he accepts. The god of the crucifixion demands that\nhe crucify, and his worshipers obey. In his name they crucify\n<em>themselves</em>, believing that the power of the Son of God is born of\nsacrifice and pain. The God of the resurrection demands <em>nothing</em>, for\nHe does not will to take away. He does not require obedience, for\nobedience implies submission. He would only have you learn your <em>own</em>\nwill and follow it, not in the spirit of sacrifice and submission, but\nin the gladness of freedom.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> Resurrection must compel your allegiance gladly because it is the\nsymbol of joy. Its whole compelling power lies in the fact that it\nrepresents what <em>you</em> want to be. The freedom to leave behind everything\nthat hurts you and humbles you and frightens you cannot be thrust upon\nyou, but it <em>can</em> be offered you through the grace of God. And you can\n<em>accept</em> it by His grace, for God <em>is</em> gracious to His Son, accepting\nhim without question as His own. Who, then, is <em>your</em> own? The Father\nhas given you all that is His, and He Himself is yours <em>with</em> them.\nGuard them in their resurrection, for otherwise you will not awake in\nGod, safely surrounded by what is yours forever.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> You will not find peace until you have removed the nails from the\nhands of God’s Son and taken the last thorn from his forehead. The love\nof God surrounds His Son, whom the god of the crucifixion condemns.\nTeach not that I died in vain. Teach rather that I did <em>not</em> die by\ndemonstrating that I live <em>in you</em>. For the <em>undoing</em> of the crucifixion\nof God’s Son is the work of the redemption, in which everyone has a part\nof equal value. God does not judge His blameless Son. Having given\n<em>Himself</em> to him, how could it be otherwise?</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> You have nailed <em>yourself</em> to a cross and placed a crown of thorns\nupon your <em>own</em> head. Yet you <em>cannot</em> crucify God’s Son, for the Will\nof God cannot die. His Son <em>has been</em> redeemed from his own crucifixion,\nand you cannot assign to death whom God has given eternal life. The\ndream of crucifixion still lies heavy on your eyes, but what you see in\ndreams is not reality. While you perceive the Son of God as crucified,\nyou are asleep. And as long as you believe that <em>you</em> can crucify him,\nyou are only having nightmares. You who are beginning to wake are still\naware of dreams and have not yet forgotten them. The forgetting of\ndreams and the awareness of Christ comes with the awakening of others to\n<em>share</em> your redemption.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> You will awaken to your <em>own</em> call, for the Call to awake is <em>within</em>\nyou. If I live in you, you <em>are</em> awake. Yet you must see the works I do\nthrough you, or you will not perceive that I have done them <em>unto</em> you.\nDo not set limits on what you believe I can do through you, or you will\nnot accept what I can do <em>for</em> you. For it is done <em>already</em>, and unless\nyou give all that you have received, you will not know that your\nRedeemer liveth and that <em>you</em> have awakened <em>with</em> Him. Redemption is\nrecognized <em>only</em> by sharing it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> God’s Son <em>is</em> saved. Bring only <em>this</em> awareness to the Sonship, and\nyou will have a part in the redemption as valuable as mine. For your\npart must be <em>like</em> mine if you learn it of me. If you believe that\n<em>yours</em> is limited, <em>you</em> are limiting <em>mine</em>. There is no order of\ndifficulty in miracles because all of God’s Sons are of equal value, and\ntheir equality is their oneness. The whole power of God is in every part\nof Him, and nothing contradictory to His Will is either great or small.\nWhat does not exist has <em>no</em> size and <em>no</em> measure. To God <em>all</em> things\nare possible. And to Christ it is given to be <em>like</em> the Father.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>69</sup> The world as <em>you</em> perceive it cannot have been created by the\nFather, for the world is <em>not</em> as you see it. God created <em>only</em> the\neternal, and everything you see is perishable. Therefore, there must be\nanother world which you do <em>not</em> see. The Bible speaks of a <em>new</em> Heaven\nand a <em>new</em> earth, yet this cannot be literally true, for the eternal\nare not <em>re</em>-created. To perceive <em>anew</em> is merely to perceive <em>again</em>,\nimplying that before, or in the interval, you were not perceiving <em>at\nall</em>. What, then, is the world that awaits your perception when you\n<em>see</em> it?</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> Every loving thought that the Son of God ever had is eternal. Those\nwhich his mind perceived in this world are the world’s <em>only</em> reality.\nThey are still perceptions because he still believes that he is\nseparate. Yet they are eternal because they are loving. And being\nloving, they are like the Father and therefore cannot die. The real\nworld can <em>actually be perceived</em>. All that is necessary is a\nwillingness to perceive nothing <em>else.</em> For if you perceive both good\n<em>and</em> evil, you are accepting both the false <em>and</em> the true <em>and making\nno distinction between them.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> The ego sees <em>some</em> good but never <em>only</em> good. That is why its\nperceptions are so variable. It does not reject goodness entirely, for\nthat you could not accept, but it always adds something that is <em>not</em>\nreal to the real, <em>thus confusing illusion and reality</em>. For perceptions\ncannot be partly true. If you believe in truth <em>and</em> illusion, you\ncannot tell <em>which</em> is true. To establish your <em>personal</em> autonomy, you\ntried to create unlike your Father, believing what you made to be\ncapable of <em>being</em> unlike Him. Yet everything in what you have made that\n<em>is</em> true <em>is</em> like Him. Only this is the real world, and perceiving\n<em>only</em> this will lead you to the real Heaven because it will make you\ncapable of <em>understanding</em> it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> The perception of goodness is not knowledge, but the denial of the\n<em>opposite</em> of goodness enables you to perceive a condition in which\nopposites do not exist. And this <em>is</em> the condition of knowledge.\n<em>Without</em> this awareness, you have not met its conditions, and until you\ndo you will not know that it is yours already. You have made many ideas\nwhich you have placed between yourselves and your Creator, and these\nbeliefs are the world as you perceive it. Truth is not absent here, but\nit <em>is</em> obscure. You do not know the difference between what you have\nmade and what God created, and so you do not know the difference between\nwhat you have made and what <em>you</em> have created.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> To believe that you can perceive the real world is to believe that\nyou can know yourself. You can know God because it is His Will to <em>be</em>\nknown. The real world is all that the Holy Spirit has saved for you out\nof what you have made, and to perceive only this is salvation because it\nis the recognition that reality is <em>only</em> what is true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> This is a very simple course. Perhaps you do not feel that a course\nwhich, in the end, teaches nothing more than that only reality is true\nis necessary. <em>But do you believe it</em>? When you have perceived the real\nworld, you will recognize that you did <em>not</em> believe it. Yet the\nswiftness with which your new and <em>only</em> real perception will be\ntranslated into knowledge will leave you only an instant to realize that\nthis judgment is true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> And then everything you made will be forgotten, the good and the bad,\nthe false and the true. For as Heaven and earth become one, even the\nreal world will vanish from your sight. The end of the world is not its\ndestruction, but its <em>translation</em> into Heaven. The re-interpretation of\nthe world is the transfer of <em>all</em> perception to knowledge. The Bible\ntells you to become as little children. Little children recognize that\nthey do not understand what they perceive, and so they <em>ask</em> what it\nmeans. Do not make the mistake of believing that <em>you</em> understand what\nyou perceive, for its meaning is lost to you. Yet the Holy Spirit has\nsaved its meaning <em>for</em> you, and if you will <em>let</em> Him interpret it for\nyou, He will restore what you have thrown away. As long as you think\n<em>you</em> know its meaning, you will see no need to ask it of Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> You do not know the meaning of <em>anything</em> you perceive. <em>Not one\nthought you hold is wholly true</em>. The recognition of this is your firm\nbeginning. You are not misguided; you have accepted no guide at all.\nInstruction in perception is your great need, for you understand\nnothing. Recognize this but do not <em>accept</em> it, for understanding is\nyour inheritance. Perceptions are learned, and you are not without a\nTeacher. Yet your willingness to learn of Him depends on your\nwillingness to question <em>everything</em> you have learned of yourself, for\nyou who have learned amiss should not be your own teachers.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> No one can withhold truth except from himself. Yet God will not\nrefuse the answer He <em>gave</em> you. Ask, then, for what is yours but which\nyou did not make, and do not defend yourself <em>against</em> truth. <em>You</em> made\nthe problem which God has answered. Ask yourselves, therefore, but one\nsimple question—</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> <em>Do I want the problem, or do I want the answer?</em>  </p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> Decide for the answer and you will have it, for you will see it as it\nis, and it is yours already.</p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> You complain that this course is not sufficiently specific for you to\nunderstand it and <em>use</em> it. Yet it has been <em>very</em> specific, and you\nhave <em>not</em> done what it specifically advocates. This is not a course in\nthe play of ideas, but in their <em>practical application</em>. Nothing could\nbe more specific than to be told very clearly that if you ask you <em>will</em>\nreceive. The Holy Spirit will answer <em>every</em> specific problem as long as\nyou believe that problems <em>are</em> specific. His answer is both many and\none, as long as you believe that the one <em>is</em> many. Realize that you are\n<em>afraid</em> of His specificity for fear of what you think it will <em>demand</em>\nof you. Yet only by asking will you learn that nothing that is of God\ndemands <em>anything</em> of you. God <em>gives</em>; He does <em>not</em> take.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> You are refusing to ask because you believe that asking is <em>taking</em>,\nand you do <em>not</em> perceive it as sharing. The Holy Spirit will give you\nonly what is yours and will take <em>nothing</em> in return. For what is yours\n<em>is</em> everything, and you share it with God. This <em>is</em> its reality. Would\nthe Holy Spirit, Who wills only to <em>restore</em>, be capable of\nmisinterpreting the question you must ask to learn His answer?</p>\n\n<p><sup>82</sup> You <em>have</em> heard the answer, but you have misunderstood the\n<em>question.</em> You have believed that to ask for guidance of the Holy\nSpirit is to ask for <em>deprivation</em>. Little Children of God, you do not\nunderstand your Father. You believe in a world that takes, because you\nbelieve that you can <em>get</em> by taking. And <em>by</em> that perception, you have\nlost sight of the real world. You are afraid of the world as <em>you</em> see\nit, but the real world is still yours for the asking. Do not deny it to\nyourself, for it can <em>only</em> free you. Nothing of God will enslave His\nSon, whom He created free and whose freedom is protected by His Being.</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> Blessed are you who will ask the truth of God without fear, for only\nthus can you learn that His answer <em>is</em> the release from fear. Beautiful\nChild of God, you are asking only for what I promised you. Do you\nbelieve I would deceive you? The Kingdom of Heaven <em>is</em> within you.\nBelieve that the truth is in me, for I <em>know</em> that it is in <em>you</em>. God’s\nSons have nothing which they do not share. Ask for truth of any Son of\nGod, and you have asked it of me. No one of us but has the answer in\nhim, to give to anyone who asks it of him. Ask anything of God’s Son and\nHis Father will answer you, for Christ is not deceived in His Father,\nand His Father is not deceived in Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>84</sup> Do not, then, be deceived in your brother and see only his loving\nthoughts as his reality, for by denying that <em>his</em> mind is split, you\nwill heal <em>yours</em>. Accept him as his Father accepts him and heal him\nunto Christ, for Christ is his healing <em>and</em> yours. Christ is the Son of\nGod, who is in no way separate from His Father, whose <em>every</em> thought is\nas loving as the Thought of His Father by which He was created. Be not\ndeceived in God’s Son, for thereby you <em>must</em> be deceived in yourself.\nAnd being deceived in yourself, you <em>are</em> deceived in your Father in\nWhom no deceit is possible.</p>\n\n<p><sup>85</sup> In the real world there is no sickness, for there is no separation\nand no division. Only loving thoughts are recognized, and because no one\nis <em>without</em> your help, the Help of God goes with <em>you</em> everywhere. As\nyou become willing to <em>accept</em> this Help by <em>asking</em> for it, you will\ngive it because you <em>want</em> it. Nothing will be beyond your healing power\nbecause nothing will be denied your simple request. What problems will\nnot disappear in the presence of God’s answer? Ask, then, to learn of\nthe reality of your brother because this is what you <em>will</em> perceive in\nhim, and you will see <em>your</em> beauty reflected in him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>86</sup> Do not accept your brother’s variable perception of himself, for his\nsplit mind is yours, and you will not accept <em>your</em> healing without his.\nFor you share the real world as you share Heaven, and his healing <em>is</em>\nyours. To love yourself is to <em>heal</em> yourself, and you cannot perceive\npart of you as sick and achieve your <em>own</em> goal. Brother, we heal\ntogether as we live together and love together. Be not deceived in God’s\nSon, for he is one with himself and one with his Father. Love him who is\nbeloved of His Father, and you will learn of the Father’s love for\n<em>you.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> If you perceive offense in a brother, pluck the offense from your\nmind, for you are offended by Christ and are deceived in Him. <em>Heal</em> in\nChrist and be not offended by Him, for there <em>is</em> no offense in Him. If\nwhat you perceive offends you, you are offended in <em>yourself</em> and are\ncondemning God’s Son, whom God condemneth not. Let the Holy Spirit\nremove <em>all</em> offense of God’s Son against himself and perceive no one\nbut through His guidance, for He would save you from <em>all</em> condemnation.\nAccept His healing power and use it for all He sends you, for He wills\nto heal the Son of God in whom He is not deceived.</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> Children perceive terrifying ghosts and monsters and dragons, and\nthey are terrified. Yet if they ask someone they trust for the <em>real</em>\nmeaning of what they perceive and are willing to let their\ninterpretations go in <em>favor</em> of reality, their fear goes with them.\nWhen a child is helped to translate his “ghost” into a curtain, his\n“monster” into a shadow, and his “dragon” into a dream, he is no longer\nafraid and laughs happily at his own fear. You, my children, are afraid\nof your brothers and of your Father and of <em>yourselves.</em> But you are\nmerely <em>deceived</em> in them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>89</sup> Ask what they <em>are</em> of the Teacher of Reality, and hearing His\nanswer, you too will laugh at your fears and replace them with peace.\nFor fear lies not in reality, but in the minds of children who do not\nunderstand reality. It is only their <em>lack</em> of understanding which\nfrightens them, and when they learn to perceive truly, they are not\nafraid. And because of this, they will ask for truth again when they are\nfrightened. It is not the <em>reality</em> of your brothers or your Father or\nyourself which frightens you. You do not know what they <em>are</em>, and so\nyou perceive them as ghosts and monsters and dragons. <em>Ask</em> of their\nreality from the One who knows it, and He will <em>tell</em> you what they are.\nFor you do not understand them, and because you are deceived by what you\nsee, you <em>need</em> reality to dispel your fears.</p>\n\n<p><sup>90</sup> Would you not exchange your fears for truth if the exchange is yours\nfor the asking? For if God is not deceived in you, you can be deceived\nonly in <em>yourself.</em> Yet you can learn the truth of yourself of the Holy\nSpirit, who will teach you that, as part of God, deceit in <em>you</em> is\nimpossible. When you perceive yourself without deceit, you will accept\nthe real world in place of the false one you have made. And then your\nFather will lean down to you and take the last step for you by raising\nyou unto Himself.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>3</sup> There is but one interpretation of all motivation that makes any\nsense. And because it is the Holy Spirit’s judgment, it requires no\neffort at all on your part. Every loving thought is true. Everything\nelse is an appeal for healing and help. That is what it is, regardless\nof the form it takes. Can anyone be justified in responding with anger\nto a plea for help? No response can be appropriate except the\nwillingness to give it to him, for this and <em>only</em> this is what he is\nasking for. Offer him anything else, and you are assuming the right to\nattack his reality by interpreting it as <em>you</em> see fit.</p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup> Perhaps the danger of this to your own mind is not yet fully apparent\nto you, but this by no means signifies that it is not perfectly clear.\nIf you maintain that an appeal for help is something else, you will\n<em>react</em> to something else, and your response will be inappropriate to\nreality as <em>it</em> is but <em>not</em> to your perception of it. This is poor\nreality testing by definition. There is nothing to prevent you from\nrecognizing <em>all</em> calls for help as exactly what they are except your\nown perceived <em>need</em> to attack. It is only <em>this</em> that makes you willing\nto engage in endless “battles” with reality in which you <em>deny</em> the\nreality of the need for healing by making it unreal. You would not do\nthis except for your <em>unwillingness</em> to perceive reality, which you\nwithhold from <em>yourself</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> It is surely good advice to tell you not to judge what you do not\nunderstand. No one with a personal investment is a reliable witness, for\ntruth to him has become what he <em>wants</em> it to be. If you are unwilling\nto perceive an appeal for help as what it <em>is</em>, it is because you are\nunwilling to <em>give</em> help <em>and to receive it</em>. The analysis of the ego’s\n“real” motivation is the modern equivalent of the inquisition, for in\nboth a brother’s errors are “uncovered” and he is then attacked <em>for his\nown good</em>. What can this be <em>but</em> projection? For <em>his</em> errors lay in\nthe minds of his interpreters, for which they punished <em>him</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> Whenever you fail to recognize a call for help, you are <em>refusing</em>\nhelp. Would you maintain that you do not <em>need</em> it? Yet this <em>is</em> what\nyou are maintaining when you refuse to recognize a brother’s appeal, for\nonly by <em>answering</em> his appeal can <em>you</em> be helped. Deny him your help,\nand you will not perceive God’s answer to <em>you</em>. The Holy Spirit does\nnot need your help in interpreting motivation, but you <em>do</em> need <em>His.</em>\nOnly <em>appreciation</em> is an appropriate response to your brother.\nGratitude is due him for both his loving thoughts and his appeals for\nhelp, for both are capable of bringing love into <em>your</em> awareness if you\nperceive them truly. And <em>all</em> your sense of strain comes from your\nattempts <em>not</em> to do just this.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> How simple, then, is God’s plan for salvation. There is but <em>one</em>\nresponse to reality, for reality evokes no conflict at all. There is but\n<em>one</em> Teacher of reality, Who understands what it <em>is.</em> He does not\nchange His Mind about reality because <em>reality</em> does not change.\nAlthough <em>your</em> interpretations of reality are meaningless in your\ndivided state, His remain consistently true. He <em>gives</em> them to you\nbecause they are <em>for</em> you. Do not attempt to “help” a brother in <em>your</em>\nway, for you cannot help yourselves. But hear his call for the help of\nGod, and you will recognize your <em>own</em> need for the Father.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> Your interpretations of your brother’s need is your interpretation of\n<em>yours</em>. By <em>giving</em> help you are <em>asking</em> for it, and if you perceive\nbut one need in yourself, you <em>will</em> be healed. For you will recognize\nGod’s answer as you want it to be, and if you want it in truth, it will\nbe truly yours. Every appeal you answer in the name of Christ brings the\nremembrance of your Father closer to <em>your</em> awareness. For the sake of\n<em>your</em> need, then, hear every call for help as what it is, so God can\nanswer <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> By applying the Holy Spirit’s interpretation of the reactions of\nothers more and more consistently, you will gain an increasing awareness\nthat <em>His</em> criteria are equally applicable to <em>you</em>. For to <em>recognize</em>\nfear is not enough to escape from it, although the recognition is\nnecessary to demonstrate the need for escape. The Holy Spirit must still\n<em>translate</em> it into truth. If you were <em>left</em> with the fear, having\nrecognized it, you would have taken a step <em>away</em> from reality, not\n<em>towards</em> it. Yet we have repeatedly emphasized the need to recognize\nfear and face it <em>without</em> disguise as a crucial step in the undoing of\nthe ego. Consider how well the Holy Spirit’s interpretation of the\nmotives of others will serve you then.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> Having taught you to accept only loving thoughts in others and to\nregard everything else as an appeal for help, He has taught you that\n<em>fear</em> is an appeal for help. This is what recognizing it <em>really</em>\nmeans. If you do not <em>protect</em> it, <em>He</em> will reinterpret it. That is the\nultimate value <em>to you</em> in learning to perceive attack as a call for\nlove. We have learned surely that fear and attack are inevitably\nassociated. If <em>only</em> attack produces fear and if you see attack as the\ncall for help that it <em>is</em>, the unreality of fear <em>must</em> dawn upon you.\nFor fear <em>is</em> a call for love in unconscious recognition of what has\nbeen denied.</p>\n\n",

The\nmask which <em>you</em> have drawn across the face of love has disappeared.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> If you would look upon love, which <em>is</em> the world’s reality, how\ncould you do better than to recognize in every defense <em>against</em> it the\nunderlying appeal <em>for</em> it? And how could you better learn of its\nreality than by answering the appeal for it by <em>giving</em> it? The Holy\nSpirit’s interpretation of fear <em>does</em> dispel it, for the <em>awareness</em> of\ntruth cannot <em>be</em> denied. Thus does the Holy Spirit replace fear with\nlove and translate error into truth. And thus will <em>you</em> learn of Him\nhow to replace your dream of separation with the fact of unity. For the\nseparation is only the <em>denial</em> of union and, correctly interpreted,\nattests to your eternal knowledge that union is true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> Miracles are merely the translation of denial into truth. If to love\noneself is to <em>heal</em> oneself, those who are sick do <em>not</em> love\nthemselves. Therefore, they are asking for the love that would heal them\nbut which they are denying to themselves. If they knew the truth about\nthemselves, they could not <em>be</em> sick. The task of the miracle-worker\nthus becomes <em>to deny the denial of truth</em>. The sick must heal\n<em>themselves</em>, for the truth is in them. Yet, having <em>obscured</em> it, the\nlight in <em>another</em> mind must shine into theirs because that light <em>is</em>\ntheirs.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> The light in them shines as brightly, <em>regardless</em> of the density of\nthe fog that obscures it. If <em>you</em> give no power to the fog to obscure\nthe light, it <em>has</em> none, for it has power only because the Son of God\ngave power to it. He must <em>himself</em> withdraw that power, remembering\nthat <em>all</em> power is of God. <em>You can remember this for all the Sonship</em>.\nDo not allow your brother not to remember, for his forgetfulness is\n<em>yours.</em> But <em>your</em> remembering is <em>his</em>, for God cannot be remembered\nalone. <em>This is what you have forgotten</em>. To perceive the healing of\nyour brother as the healing of yourself is thus the way to remember God.\nFor you forgot your brothers <em>with</em> Him, and God’s answer to your\nforgetting is but the way to remember.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> Perceive in sickness but another call for love and offer your brother\nwhat he believes he cannot offer himself. Whatever the sickness, there\nis but <em>one</em> remedy. You will be made whole as you <em>make</em> whole, for to\nperceive in sickness the appeal for health is to recognize in hatred the\ncall for love. And to give a brother what he <em>really</em> wants is to offer\nit unto yourself, for your Father wills you to know your brother <em>as</em>\nyourself. Answer <em>his</em> call for love and <em>yours</em> is answered. Healing is\nthe love of Christ for His Father and for <em>Himself.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> Remember what we said about the frightening perceptions of little\nchildren which terrify them because they do not understand them. If they\nask for enlightenment and <em>accept</em> it, their fears vanish, but if they\n<em>hide</em> their nightmares, they will <em>keep</em> them. It is easy to help an\nuncertain child, for he recognizes that he does not know what his\nperceptions mean. Yet you believe that you <em>do</em> know. Little children,\nyou are hiding your heads under the covers of the heavy blankets you\nhave laid upon yourselves. You are hiding your nightmares in the\ndarkness of your own certainty and refusing to open your eyes <em>and look\nat them.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> Let us not save nightmares, for they are not fitting offerings for\nChrist, and so they are not fit gifts for <em>you</em>. Take off the covers and\nlook at what you are afraid of. Only the <em>anticipation</em> will frighten\nyou, for the reality of nothingness cannot <em>be</em> frightening. Let us not\ndelay this, for your dream of hatred will not leave you without help,\nand help is here. Learn to be quiet in the midst of turmoil, for\nquietness is the end of strife and this is the journey to peace. Look\nstraight at every image that rises to delay you, for the goal is\ninevitable because it is eternal. The goal of love is but your right,\nand it belongs to you <em>despite</em> your preference.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> <em>You still want what God wills</em>, and no nightmare can defeat a Child\nof God in his purpose. For your purpose was given you by God, and you\nmust accomplish it <em>because</em> it is His Will. Awake and remember your\npurpose, for it is <em>your</em> will to do so. What has been accomplished for\nyou <em>must</em> be yours. Do not let your hatred stand in the way of love,\nfor <em>nothing</em> can withstand the love of Christ for His Father or His\nFather’s love for Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> A little while and you <em>will</em> see me, for I am not hidden because\n<em>you</em> are hiding. I will awaken you as surely as I awakened myself, for\nI awoke <em>for</em> you. In <em>my</em> resurrection is <em>your</em> release. Our mission\nis to escape <em>crucifixion</em>, not redemption. Trust in my help, for I did\nnot walk alone, and I will walk with you as our Father walked with me.\nDid you not know that I walked with Him in peace? And does not that mean\nthat peace goes with <em>us</em> on the journey?</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> There is no fear in perfect love. We will but be making perfect to\nyou what is <em>already</em> perfect <em>in</em> you. You do not fear the <em>unknown</em>,\nbut the <em>known.</em> You will not fail in your mission because I failed not\nin mine. Give me but a little trust in the name of the <em>complete</em> trust\nI have in you, and we will easily accomplish the goal of perfection\ntogether. For perfection <em>is</em> and cannot <em>be</em> denied. To deny the denial\nof perfection is not so difficult as the denial of truth, and what we\ncan accomplish together <em>must</em> be believed when you <em>see</em> it as\naccomplished.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> You who have tried to banish love have not succeeded, but you who\nchoose to banish fear <em>will</em> succeed. The Lord is with you, but you know\nit not. Yet your Redeemer liveth and abideth in you in the peace out of\nwhich He was created. Would you not exchange <em>this</em> awareness for the\nawareness of your fear? When we have overcome fear—not by hiding it, not\nby minimizing it, not by denying its full import in any way—this <em>is</em>\nwhat you will really see. You cannot lay aside the obstacle to real\nvision without looking upon it, for to lay aside means to judge\n<em>against</em>. If <em>you</em> will look, the Holy Spirit will judge and will judge\ntruly. He cannot shine away what <em>you</em> keep hidden, for you have not\noffered it to Him, and He cannot take it <em>from</em> you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> We are therefore embarking on an organized, well-structured, and\ncarefully planned program aimed at learning how to offer to the Holy\nSpirit everything you do <em>not</em> want. <em>He</em> knows what to do with it. You\ndo <em>not</em> know how to use what He knows. Whatever is revealed to Him that\nis not of God is gone. Yet you must reveal it to <em>yourself</em> in perfect\nwillingness, for otherwise His knowledge remains useless to you. Surely\nHe will not fail to help you, since help is His <em>only</em> purpose. Do you\nnot have greater reason for fearing the world as <em>you</em> perceive it than\nfor looking at the cause of fear and letting it go forever?</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>24</sup> I once asked if you were willing to sell all you have and give to the\npoor and follow me. This is what I meant: If you had no investment in\nanything in this world, you could teach the poor where their treasure\n<em>is.</em> The poor are merely those who have invested wrongly, and they are\npoor indeed! Because they are in need, it is given you to help them\nsince <em>you</em> are among them. Consider how perfectly your lesson would be\nlearned if you were unwilling to <em>share</em> their poverty. For poverty is\nlack, and there is but <em>one</em> lack since there is but <em>one</em> need.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> Suppose a brother insists on having you do something you think you do\nnot want to do. The very fact of his insistence should tell you that he\nbelieves salvation lies in it. If you insist on refusing and experience\na quick response of opposition, you are believing that <em>your</em> salvation\nlies in <em>not</em> doing it. You, then, are making the same mistake that he\nis and are making his error real to <em>both</em> of you. Insistence means\ninvestment, and what you invest in is <em>always</em> related to your notion of\nsalvation. The question is always two-fold—first, <em>what</em> is to be saved,\nand second, <em>how</em> can it be saved?</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> Whenever you become angry with a brother, for <em>whatever</em> reason, you\nare believing that the <em>ego</em> is to be saved and to be saved by <em>attack</em>.\nIf <em>he</em> attacks, you are agreeing with this belief, and if <em>you</em> attack,\nyou are reinforcing it. <em>Remember that those who attack are poor</em>. Their\npoverty asks for gifts, <em>not</em> for further impoverishment. You who could\nhelp them are surely acting destructively if you accept their poverty as\n<em>yours.</em> If you had not invested as <em>they</em> had, it would never occur to\nyou to overlook their need.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> Recognize <em>what does not matter</em>, and if your brothers ask you for\nsomething “outrageous,” do it <em>because</em> it does not matter. Refuse and\nyour opposition establishes that it <em>does</em> matter to you. It is only\n<em>you</em>, therefore, who have made the request outrageous, for nothing can\n<em>be</em> asked of you, and every request of a brother is for <em>you.</em> Why\nwould you insist in <em>denying</em> him? For to do so is to deny yourself and\nimpoverish both. <em>He</em> is asking for salvation, as <em>you</em> are. Poverty is\nof the ego and <em>never</em> of God. No “outrageous” request can be made of\none who recognizes what is valuable and wants to accept nothing else.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> Salvation is for the mind, and it is attained through peace. This is\nthe <em>only</em> thing that can be saved and the <em>only</em> way to save it. Any\nresponse <em>other</em> than love arises from a confusion about the “what” and\nthe “how” of salvation, and this is the <em>only</em> answer. Never lose sight\nof this, and never allow yourself to believe even for an instant that\nthere <em>is</em> another answer. For you will surely place yourself among the\npoor, who do not understand that they dwell in abundance and that\nsalvation is come.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> To identify with the ego is to attack yourself and <em>make</em> yourself\npoor. That is why everyone who identifies with the ego feels deprived.\nWhat he <em>experiences</em> then is depression or anger, but what he <em>did</em> is\nto exchange his self-love for self-hate, making him <em>afraid</em> of himself.\nHe does <em>not</em> realize this. Even if he is fully aware of anxiety, he\ndoes not perceive its source as his own <em>ego identification</em>, and he\n<em>always</em> tries to handle it by making some sort of insane “arrangement”\nwith the world. He always perceives this world as <em>outside</em> himself, for\nthis is crucial to his adjustment. He does not realize that he <em>makes</em>\nthis world, for there <em>is</em> no world outside of him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> If only the loving thoughts of God’s Son are the world’s reality, the\nreal world <em>must</em> be in his mind. His insane thoughts, too, must be in\nhis mind, but an internal conflict of this magnitude he cannot tolerate.\nA split mind <em>is</em> endangered, and the recognition that it encompasses\ncompletely opposed thoughts within itself <em>is</em> intolerable. Therefore\nthe mind projects the split, <em>not</em> the reality. Everything you perceive\nas the outside world is merely your attempt to maintain your ego\nidentification, for everyone believes that identification is salvation.\nYet consider what has happened, for thoughts <em>do</em> have consequences to\nthe thinker.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> You are <em>at odds</em> with the world as you perceive it because you think\n<em>it</em> is antagonistic to <em>you</em>. This is a necessary consequence of what\nyou have done. You have projected outward what <em>is</em> antagonistic to what\nis inward, and therefore you would <em>have</em> to perceive it this way. That\nis why you must realize that your hatred is <em>in</em> your mind and <em>not</em>\noutside it before you can get rid of it and why you must get rid of it\n<em>before</em> you can perceive the world as it really is.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> We once said that God so loved the world that He gave it to His\nonly-begotten Son. God <em>does</em> love the real world, and those who\nperceive <em>its</em> reality cannot <em>see</em> the world of death. For death is\n<em>not</em> of the real world, in which everything is eternal. God gave you\nthe real world in exchange for the one you made out of your split mind,\nand which <em>is</em> the symbol of death. For if you could <em>really</em> separate\nyourselves from the Mind of God, you <em>would</em> die, and the world you\nperceive <em>is</em> a world of separation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> You were willing to accept even death to deny your Father. Yet He\nwould not have it so, and so it is <em>not</em> so. You still could not will\nagainst Him, and that is why you have no control over the world you\nmade. It is not a world of will because it is governed by the desire to\nbe unlike Him, and this desire is <em>not</em> will. The world you made is\ntherefore totally chaotic, governed by arbitrary and senseless “laws,”\nand without meaning of <em>any</em> kind. For it was made out of what you do\n<em>not</em> want, projected from your mind because you were afraid of it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> Yet this world is <em>only</em> in the mind of its maker along with his\n<em>real</em> salvation. Do not believe it is outside of yourself, for only by\nrecognizing <em>where</em> it is will you gain control over it. For you <em>do</em>\nhave control over your mind since the mind is the mechanism of decision.\nIf you will recognize that <em>all</em> attack which you perceive is in your\nown mind <em>and nowhere else</em>, you will at last have placed its source,\nand where it began it must end. For in this same place also lies\nsalvation. The altar of God where Christ abideth is there.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> You have defiled the altar but <em>not</em> the world. Yet Christ has placed\nthe Atonement on the altar <em>for</em> you. Bring your perceptions of the\nworld to this altar, for it is the altar to truth. There you will see\nyour vision changed, and there you will learn to see truly. From this\nplace, where God and His Son dwell in peace and where you are welcome,\nyou will look out in peace and behold the world truly. Yet to find the\nplace, you must relinquish your investment in the world as <em>you</em> have\nprojected it, allowing the Holy Spirit to project the real world to you\nfrom the altar of God.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>36</sup> The ego is certain that love is dangerous, and this is always its\ncentral teaching. It never <em>puts</em> it this way; on the contrary, everyone\nwho believes that the ego is salvation is intensely engaged in the\nsearch for love. Yet the ego, though encouraging the search very\nactively, makes one proviso—do not <em>find</em> it. Its dictates, then, can be\nsummed up simply as, “Seek and do <em>not</em> find.” This is the one promise\nthe ego holds out to you and the one promise it will <em>keep</em>. For the ego\npursues its goal with fanatic insistence, and its reality testing,\nthough severely impaired, is completely consistent.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> The search which the ego undertakes is therefore bound to be\ndefeated. And since it also teaches that it is <em>your</em> identification,\nits guidance leads you to a journey which must end in perceived\n<em>self</em>-defeat. For the ego <em>cannot</em> love, and in its frantic search for\nlove, it is seeking what it is <em>afraid</em> to find. The search is\ninevitable because the ego is part of your mind, and because of its\nsource, the ego is not wholly split off, or it could not be believed at\nall. For it is <em>your</em> mind that believes in it and gives existence to\nit. Yet it is also your mind that has the power to <em>deny</em> the ego’s\nexistence, and you will surely do so when you realize exactly what the\njourney is on which the ego sets you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> It is surely obvious that no one wants to find what would <em>utterly</em>\ndefeat him. Being unable to love, the ego would be totally inadequate in\nlove’s presence, for it could not respond at all. You would <em>have</em> to\nabandon the ego’s guidance, for it would be quite apparent that it had\nnot taught you the response pattern you <em>need.</em> The ego will therefore\n<em>distort</em> love and teach you that love calls forth the responses which\nthe ego <em>can</em> teach. Follow its teaching, then, and you will <em>search</em>\nfor love but will not <em>recognize</em> it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> Do you realize that the ego must set you on a journey which cannot\n<em>but</em> lead to a sense of futility and depression? To seek and <em>not</em> to\nfind is hardly joyous. Is this the promise <em>you</em> would keep? The Holy\nSpirit offers you another promise, and one that will lead to joy. For\n<em>His</em> promise is always, “Seek and you will <em>find</em>,” and under His\nguidance you cannot <em>be</em> defeated. His is the journey to\n<em>accomplishment</em>, and the goal He sets before you He will <em>give</em> you.\nFor He will never deceive God’s Son, whom He loves with the love of the\nFather.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> You <em>will</em> undertake a journey because you are <em>not</em> at home in this\nworld. And you <em>will</em> search for your home whether you know where it is\nor not. If you believe it is outside yourself, the search will be\nfutile, for you will be seeking it where it is not. You do not know how\nto look within yourself, for you do not <em>believe</em> your home is there.\nYet the Holy Spirit knows it <em>for</em> you, and He will guide you <em>to</em> your\nhome because that is His mission. As He fulfills <em>His</em> mission, He will\nteach you <em>yours</em>, for your mission is the same as His. By guiding your\n<em>brothers</em> home, you are but following Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> Behold the Guide your Father gave you that you might learn you have\neternal life. For death is not your Father’s Will nor yours, and\nwhatever is true <em>is</em> the Will of the Father. You pay no price for life,\nfor that was given you, but you <em>do</em> pay a price for death, and a very\nheavy one. If death is your treasure, you will sell everything else to\npurchase it. And you will believe that you <em>have</em> purchased it <em>because</em>\nyou have sold everything else. Yet you <em>cannot</em> sell the Kingdom of\nHeaven. Your inheritance can neither be bought <em>nor</em> sold. There can\n<em>be</em> no disinherited parts of the Sonship, for God is whole, and all His\nextensions are like Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> The Atonement was not the price of our wholeness, but it <em>was</em> the\nprice of your <em>awareness</em> of your wholeness. For what you chose to\n“sell” had to be kept for you since you could not “buy” it back. Yet\n<em>you</em> must invest in it, not with money but <em>with your spirit</em>. For\nSpirit is will, and will <em>is</em> the “price” of the Kingdom. Your\ninheritance awaits only the recognition that you have <em>been</em> redeemed.\nThe Holy Spirit guides you into life eternal, but <em>you</em> must relinquish\nyour investment in death, or you will not <em>see</em> life though it is all\naround you.</p>\n\n",

Because\nyou had attacked yourself and believed that the attack was <em>effective</em>,\nyou behold yourself as weakened. No longer perceiving yourself and all\nyour brothers as equal and regarding yourself as <em>weaker</em>, you attempt\nto “equalize” the situation <em>you</em> have made. You use attack to do so\nbecause you believe that attack was successful in weakening <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> That is why the recognition of your <em>own</em> invulnerability is so\nimportant in the restoration of your sanity. For if you accept your\ninvulnerability, you are recognizing that attack <em>has</em> no effect.\nAlthough you have attacked yourself, and very brutally, you will\ndemonstrate that <em>nothing happened</em>. Therefore, by attacking you have\nnot done <em>anything</em>. Once you realize this, there is no longer any\n<em>sense</em> in attack, for it manifestly <em>does not work</em> and <em>cannot</em>\nprotect you. Yet the recognition of your invulnerability has more than\nnegative value. If your attacks on yourself have <em>failed</em> to weaken you,\n<em>you are still strong</em>. You therefore have no need to “equalize” the\nsituation to establish your strength.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> You will never realize the utter uselessness of attack <em>except</em> by\nrecognizing that your attack on <em>yourself</em> had no effects. For others\n<em>do</em> react to attack if they perceive it, and if you are trying to\nattack <em>them</em>, you will be unable to avoid interpreting this as\nreinforcement.

You could not trust your own love when you have\n<em>attacked</em> it. You cannot learn of perfect love with a split mind\nbecause a split mind has <em>made</em> itself a poor learner. You tried to make\nthe separation eternal because you wanted to retain the characteristics\nof creation with your own <em>content.</em> Yet creation is <em>not</em> of you, and\npoor learners need special teaching. You have learning handicaps in a\nvery literal sense.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> There are areas in your learning skills which are so impaired that\nyou can progress only under constant, clear-cut direction provided by a\nTeacher Who can <em>transcend</em> your limited resources. He <em>becomes</em> your\nresource because, of <em>yourself</em>, you <em>cannot</em> learn. The learning\nsituation in which you placed yourself <em>is</em> impossible, and in this\nsituation you clearly require a special Teacher and a special\ncurriculum. Poor learners are not good choices for teachers, either for\nthemselves or for anyone else. You would hardly turn to <em>them</em> to\nestablish the curriculum by which they can <em>escape</em> from their\nlimitations. If they understood what is beyond them, they would not <em>be</em>\nhandicapped.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> You do not know the meaning of love, and that <em>is</em> your handicap. Do\nnot attempt to teach yourselves what you do not understand, and do not\ntry to set up curriculum goals where yours have clearly failed. <em>Your</em>\nlearning goal has been <em>not</em> to learn, and this <em>cannot</em> lead to\nsuccessful learning. You cannot transfer what you have not learned, and\nthe impairment of the ability to generalize is a crucial learning\nfailure. Would you ask those who have <em>failed</em> to learn what learning\naids are <em>for</em>? <em>They do not know</em>. For if they could interpret the aids\ncorrectly, they would have learned from them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> We have said that the ego’s rule is, “Seek and do <em>not</em> find.”\nTranslated into curricular terms, this is the same as saying, “<em>Try</em> to\nlearn but do <em>not</em> succeed.” The result of this curriculum goal is\nobvious. Every legitimate teaching aid, every real instruction, and\nevery sensible guide to learning <em>will be misinterpreted</em>. For they are\nall for learning facilitation, which this strange curriculum goal is\n<em>against</em>. If you are trying to learn how <em>not</em> to learn and are using\nthe aim of teaching to <em>defeat</em> itself, what can you expect <em>but</em>\nconfusion? The curriculum does not make <em>sense.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> This kind of “learning” has so weakened your mind that you <em>cannot</em>\nlove, for the curriculum you have chosen is <em>against</em> love and amounts\nto a course in <em>how to attack yourself</em>. A necessary minor,\nsupplementing this major curriculum goal, is learning how <em>not</em> to\novercome the split which made this goal believable. And you can <em>not</em>\novercome it, for all <em>your</em> learning is on its <em>behalf</em>. Yet your will\nspeaks against your learning, as your learning speaks against your will,\nand so you fight <em>against</em> learning and succeed, for that <em>is</em> your\nwill. But you do not realize even yet that there <em>is</em> something you <em>do</em>\nwill to learn, and that you can learn it because it <em>is</em> your will to do\nso.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> You who have tried to learn what you do <em>not</em> will should take heart,\nfor although the curriculum you set yourself is depressing indeed, it is\nmerely ridiculous if you look at it. Is it <em>possible</em> that the way to\nachieve a goal is <em>not</em> to attain it? Resign <em>now</em> as your own teachers.\n<em>This</em> resignation will <em>not</em> lead to depression. It is merely the\nresult of an honest appraisal of what you have taught yourselves and of\nthe learning outcomes which have resulted. Under the proper learning\nconditions, which you can neither provide nor understand, you will\nbecome excellent learners <em>and</em> teachers. But it is not so yet and will\nnot <em>be</em> so until the whole learning situation as <em>you</em> have set it up\nis reversed.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> Your learning <em>potential</em>, properly understood, is limitless because\nit will lead you to God. You can <em>teach</em> the way to Him <em>and</em> learn it\nif you follow the Teacher Who knows it and His curriculum for learning\nit. The curriculum is totally unambiguous because the goal is <em>not</em>\ndivided, and the means and the end are in <em>complete</em> accord. You need\noffer only <em>undivided attention</em>. Everything else will be <em>given</em> you.\nFor it is <em>your</em> will to learn aright, and nothing can oppose the Will\nof God’s Son. His learning is as unlimited as <em>he</em> is.</p>\n\n",

Make the world real unto <em>yourself</em>, for the real world is the\ngift of the Holy Spirit, and so it <em>belongs</em> to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Correction is for all who cannot see. To open the eyes of the blind\nis the Holy Spirit’s mission, for He knows that they have not lost their\nvision but merely sleep. He would awaken them from the sleep of\nforgetting to the remembering of God. Christ’s eyes are open, and He\nwill look upon whatever you see with love if you accept His vision as\nyours.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> The Holy Spirit keeps the vision of Christ for every Son of God who\nsleeps. In His sight the Son of God is perfect, and He longs to share\nHis vision with you. He will show you the real world because God gave\nyou Heaven. Through Him your Father calls His Son to remember. The\nawakening of His Son begins with his investment in the <em>real</em> world, and\nby this he will learn to reinvest in <em>himself</em>. For reality is one with\nthe Father <em>and</em> the Son, and the Holy Spirit blesses the real world in\nTheir Name.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> When you have seen this real world, as you will surely do, you <em>will</em>\nremember us. Yet you must learn the cost of sleeping and <em>refuse</em> to pay\nit. Only then will you decide to awaken. And then the real world will\nspring to your sight, for Christ has never slept. He is waiting to be\nseen, for He has never lost sight of <em>you</em>. He looks quietly on the real\nworld, which He would share with you because He knows of the Father’s\nlove for Him. And knowing this, He would give you what is yours. In\nperfect peace He waits for you at His Father’s altar, holding out the\nFather’s love to you in the quiet light of the Holy Spirit’s blessing.\nFor the Holy Spirit will lead everyone home to his Father, where Christ\nwaits as his Self.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> Every Child of God is one in Christ, for his Being is in Christ as\nChrist’s is in God. Christ’s love for you is His love for His Father,\nwhich He knows because He knows His Father’s love for Him. When the Holy\nSpirit has at last led you to Christ at the altar to His Father,\nperception fuses into knowledge because perception has become so holy\nthat its transfer to holiness is merely its natural extension. Love\ntransfers to love without any interference, for the situations are\nidentical. [Only the <em>ability</em> to make this transfer is the product of\nlearning.] As you perceive more and more common elements in <em>all</em>\nsituations, the transfer of your training under the Holy Spirit’s\nguidance increases and becomes generalized. Gradually you learn to apply\nit to everyone and everything, for its applicability <em>is</em> universal.\nWhen this has been accomplished, perception and knowledge have become so\nsimilar that they share the unification of the laws of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> What is one cannot be perceived as separate, and the denial of the\nseparation <em>is</em> the reinstatement of knowledge. At the altar of God, the\nholy perception of God’s Son becomes so enlightened that light streams\ninto it, and the Spirit of God’s Son shines in the Mind of the Father\nand becomes one with it. Very gently does God shine upon Himself, loving\nthe extension of Himself which is His Son. The world has no purpose as\nit blends into the purpose of God. For the real world has slipped\nquietly into Heaven, where everything eternal in it has always been.\nThere the Redeemer and the redeemed join in perfect love of God and of\neach other. Heaven is your home, and being in God, it must <em>also</em> be in\nyou.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>61</sup> Miracles demonstrate that learning has occurred under the right\nguidance, for learning is invisible, and what has been learned can be\nrecognized only by its <em>results.</em> Its generalization is demonstrated as\nyou use it in more and more situations. You will recognize that you have\nlearned there is no order of difficulty in miracles when you have\napplied them to <em>all</em> situations. There <em>is</em> no situation to which\nmiracles do not apply, and by applying them to all situations, you will\ngain the real world. For in this holy perception, you will be made\nwhole, and the Atonement will radiate from <em>your</em> acceptance of it for\n<em>yourself</em> to everyone the Holy Spirit sends you for your blessing. In\nevery Child of God His blessing lies, and in <em>your</em> blessing of the\nChildren of God is His blessing to <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> Everyone in the world must play his part in the redemption of the\nworld to recognize that the world <em>has been</em> redeemed. You cannot see\nthe invisible. Yet if you see its effects, you <em>know</em> it must be there.\nBy perceiving what it <em>does</em>, you recognize its being. And by <em>what</em> it\ndoes, you learn what it <em>is</em>. You cannot <em>see</em> your abilities, but you\ngain confidence in their existence as they enable you to <em>act</em>. And the\n<em>results</em> of your actions you <em>can</em> see.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> The Holy Spirit is invisible, but you can see the <em>results</em> of His\nPresence, and through them you will learn that He is there. What He\nenables you to do is clearly <em>not</em> of this world, for miracles violate\nevery law of reality as this world judges it. Every law of time and\nspace, of magnitude and mass, of prediction and control is transcended,\nfor what the Holy Spirit enables you to do is clearly beyond <em>all</em> of\nthem. Perceiving His results, you will understand <em>where</em> He must be and\nfinally <em>know</em> what He is.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> You cannot see the Holy Spirit, but you can see His manifestations.\nAnd unless you do, you will not realize He is there. Miracles are His\nwitnesses and speak for His Presence. What you cannot see becomes real\nto you only through the witnesses who speak for it. For you can be\n<em>aware</em> of what you cannot see, and it can become compellingly real to\nyou as its presence becomes manifest <em>through</em> you. Do the Holy Spirit’s\nwork, for you <em>share</em> in His function. As your function in Heaven is\ncreation, so your function on earth is healing. God shares His function\nwith you in Heaven, and the Holy Spirit shares His with you on earth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> As long as you believe you have two functions, so long will you need\ncorrection. For this belief is the <em>destruction</em> of peace, a goal in\ndirect opposition to the Holy Spirit’s purpose. You see what you\n<em>expect</em>, and you expect what you <em>invite.</em> Your perception is the\nresult of your invitation, coming to you as you sent for it. Whose\nmanifestations would you see? Of whose presence would you be convinced?\nFor you will believe in what you <em>manifest</em>, and as you look out, so\nwill you see in. Two ways of looking at the world are in your mind, and\nyour perception will reflect the guidance you chose.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> I am the manifestation of the Holy Spirit, and when you see me, it\nwill be because you have invited Him. For He <em>will</em> send you His\nwitnesses if you will but look upon them. Remember always that you see\nwhat you seek, for what you seek you <em>will</em> find. The ego finds what\n<em>it</em> seeks and <em>only</em> that. It does not find love, for that is <em>not</em>\nwhat it is seeking. Yet seeking and finding are the same, and if you\nseek for two goals you will find them, but you will <em>recognize neither</em>.\nFor you will think they are the same because you <em>want</em> them both. The\nmind always strives for integration, and if it is split and wants to\n<em>keep</em> the split, it will believe it has one goal by <em>making</em> it one.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> We said before that <em>what</em> you project is up to you, but it is <em>not</em>\nup to you <em>whether</em> to project, for projection is a law of mind.\nPerception <em>is</em> projection, and you look in <em>before</em> you look out. As\nyou look in you choose the guide for seeing, and <em>then</em> you look out and\nbehold his witnesses. This is <em>why</em> you find what you seek. What you\nwant in <em>yourself</em>, you will make manifest by projection, and you will\naccept it <em>from</em> the world because you put it there <em>by</em> wanting it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> When you think you are projecting what you do <em>not</em> want, it is still\nbecause you <em>do</em> want it. This leads directly to dissociation, for it\nrepresents the acceptance of two goals, each perceived in a <em>different</em>\nplace, separated from each other <em>because</em> you made them different. The\nmind then sees a divided world <em>outside</em> itself but not <em>within</em>. This\ngives it an illusion of integrity and enables it to believe that it is\npursuing one goal. As long as you perceive the world as split, <em>you</em> are\nnot healed. For to be healed is to pursue one goal because you have\n<em>accepted</em> only one and <em>want</em> but one.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> When you want <em>only</em> love you will see nothing else. The\ncontradictory nature of the witnesses you perceive is merely the\nreflection of your conflicting invitations. You have looked upon your\nminds and accepted opposition there, having <em>sought</em> it there. But do\nnot then believe that the witnesses for opposition are true, for they\nattest only to <em>your</em> decision about reality, returning to you the\nmessage you <em>gave</em> them. Love is recognized by its messengers. If you\nmake love manifest, its messengers will come to you because you\n<em>invited</em> them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> The power of decision is your one remaining freedom as a prisoner of\nthis world. <em>You can decide to see it right.</em> What <em>you</em> made of it is\n<em>not</em> its reality, for its reality is only what you <em>gave</em> it. You\ncannot really give anything but love to anyone or anything, nor can you\nreally <em>receive</em> anything else from them. If you think you have received\nanything else, it is because you have looked within and thought you saw\nthe power to give something else <em>within yourself</em>. It was only this\ndecision that determined what you found, for it was the decision of what\nyou <em>sought</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> You are afraid of me because you looked within and are afraid of what\nyou saw. Yet you could not have seen reality, for the reality of your\nmind is the loveliest of God’s creations. Coming only from God, its\npower and grandeur could only bring you peace <em>if you really looked upon\nit.</em> If you are afraid, it is because you saw something <em>that is not\nthere.</em> Yet in that same place, you could have looked upon me and all\nyour brothers in the perfect safety of the mind which created us. For we\nare there in the peace of the Father, Who wills to project His peace\nthrough <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> When you have accepted your mission to <em>project</em> peace, you will\n<em>find</em> it, for by <em>making it manifest</em>, you will <em>see</em> it. Its holy\nwitnesses will surround you because you <em>called</em> upon them and they will\ncome to you. I have heard your call and I have answered it, but you will\nnot look upon me nor <em>hear</em> the answer which you sought. That is because\nyou do not yet want <em>only</em> that. Yet as I become more real to you, you\nwill learn that you <em>do</em> want only that. And you will see me as you look\nwithin, and we will look upon the world as God created it together.\nThrough the eyes of Christ, <em>only</em> the real world exists and can <em>be</em>\nseen. As you decide, so will you see. And all that you see but witnesses\nto your decision.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> When you look within and see me, it will be because you have decided\nto manifest truth. And as you manifest it, you will see it both without\n<em>and</em> within, for you will see it without <em>because</em> you saw it first\nwithin. Everything you behold without is a judgment of what you beheld\nwithin. If it is <em>your</em> judgment, it will be wrong, for judgment is not\nyour function. If it is the judgment of the Holy Spirit, it will be\nright, for judgment <em>is</em> His function. You share His function only by\njudging as <em>He</em> does, reserving no judgment at all unto yourselves. For\nyou will judge <em>against</em> yourselves, but <em>He</em> will judge <em>for</em> you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> Remember, then, that whenever you look without and react unfavorably\nto what you see, you have judged yourself unworthy and have condemned\nyourself to death. The death penalty is the ego’s ultimate goal, for it\nfully believes that you are a criminal, as deserving of death as God\nknows you are deserving of life. The death penalty never leaves the\nego’s mind, for that is what it always reserves for you in the end.\nWanting to kill you as the final expression of its feeling for you, it\nlets you live but to await death. It will torment you while you live,\nbut its hatred is not satisfied until you die. For your destruction is\nthe one end toward which it works, and the only end with which it will\nbe satisfied.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> The ego is not a traitor to God to Whom treachery is impossible, but\nit <em>is</em> a traitor to you who believe <em>you</em> have been treacherous to your\nFather. That is why the <em>undoing</em> of guilt is an essential part of the\nHoly Spirit’s teaching. For as long as you feel guilty, you are\nlistening to the voice of the ego, which tells you that you <em>have</em> been\ntreacherous to God and therefore <em>deserve</em> death. You will think that\ndeath comes from God and <em>not</em> from the ego because, by confusing\nyourself <em>with</em> the ego, you believe that <em>you</em> want death. And from\nwhat you want, God does <em>not</em> save you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> When you are tempted to yield to the desire for death, <em>remember that\nI did not die</em>. You will realize that this is true when you look within\nand <em>see</em> me. Would I have overcome death for myself alone? And would\neternal life have been given me of the Father <em>unless</em> He had also given\nit to you? When you learn to make <em>me</em> manifest, <em>you</em> will never see\ndeath. For you will have looked upon the deathless in <em>yourself</em>, and\nyou will see only the eternal as you look out upon a world that <em>cannot</em>\ndie.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>77</sup> Do you <em>really</em> believe that you can kill the Son of God? The Father\nhas hidden His Son safely within Himself and kept him far away from your\ndestructive thoughts, but <em>you</em> know neither the Father nor the Son\nbecause of them. You attack the real world every day and every hour and\nevery minute, and yet you are surprised that you cannot see it. If you\nseek love in order to attack it, you will <em>never</em> find it. For if love\nis sharing, how can you find it except through <em>itself</em>? Offer it and it\nwill come to you because it is drawn to itself. But offer attack and it\nwill remain hidden, for it can live only in peace.</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> God’s Son is as safe as his Father, for the Son knows his Father’s\nprotection and <em>cannot</em> fear. His Father’s love holds him in perfect\npeace, and needing nothing, he <em>asks</em> for nothing. Yet he is far from\nyou whose Self he is, for you chose to attack him, and he disappeared\nfrom your sight into his Father. <em>He</em> did not change, but <em>you</em> did. For\na split mind and all its works were not created by the Father and could\nnot live in the knowledge of Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> When you made what is <em>not</em> true visible, what <em>is</em> true became\ninvisible. Yet it cannot be invisible in <em>itself</em>, for the Holy Spirit\nsees it with perfect clarity. It is invisible to you because you are\nlooking at something <em>else</em>. Yet it is no more up to you to decide what\nis visible and what is invisible than it is up to you to decide what\nreality is. What can be seen is what the <em>Holy Spirit</em> sees. The\ndefinition of reality is God’s, not yours. <em>He</em> created it, and <em>He</em>\nknows what it is. You who knew have forgotten, and unless He had given\nyou a way to remember, you would have condemned yourselves to oblivion.</p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> Because of your Father’s love you can <em>never</em> forget Him, for no one\ncan forget what God Himself placed in his memory. You can <em>deny</em> it, but\nyou cannot <em>lose</em> it. A Voice will answer every question you ask, and a\nVision will correct the perception of everything you see. For what you\nhave made invisible is the <em>only</em> truth, and what you have not heard is\nthe <em>only</em> answer. God would reunite you with yourself and did not\nabandon you in your seeming distress. You are waiting only for Him and\ndo not know it. Yet His memory shines in your minds and cannot <em>be</em>\nobliterated. It is no more past than future, being forever always.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> You have but to ask for this memory, and you <em>will</em> remember. Yet the\nmemory of God cannot shine in a mind which has <em>made</em> it invisible and\nwants to <em>keep</em> it so. For the memory of God can dawn only in a mind\nthat wills to remember and that has relinquished the insane desire to\ncontrol reality. You who cannot even control yourselves should hardly\naspire to control the universe. But look upon what you have made of it\nand rejoice that it is not so. Son of God, be not content with nothing!\nWhat is not real cannot <em>be</em> seen and <em>has</em> no value. God could not\noffer His Son what has no value, nor could His Son receive it. You were\nredeemed the instant you thought you had deserted Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>82</sup> Everything you made has never been and is invisible because the Holy\nSpirit does not see it. Yet what He <em>does</em> see is yours to behold, and\nthrough His vision your perception is healed. You have made the\ninvisible the only truth that this world holds. Valuing nothing, you\nhave sought nothing and <em>found</em> nothing. By making nothing <em>real</em> to\nyou, you have <em>seen</em> it. <em>But it is not there</em>. And Christ is invisible\nto you because of what you have made visible to <em>yourselves</em>. Yet it\ndoes not matter how much distance you have tried to interpose between\nyour awareness and truth. God’s Son <em>can</em> be seen because his vision is\nshared. The Holy Spirit looks upon him and sees nothing else in <em>you.</em>\nWhat is invisible to you is perfect in His sight and encompasses <em>all</em>\nof it. He has remembered you because He forgot not the Father.</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> You looked upon the unreal and found despair. Yet by seeking the\nunreal, what else <em>could</em> you find? The unreal world <em>is</em> a thing of\ndespair, for it can never be. And you who share God’s Being with Him\ncould never be content without reality. What God did not give you has no\npower over you, and the attraction of love for love remains\nirresistible. For it is the function of love to unite all things unto\nitself, and to hold all things together by extending its wholeness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>84</sup> The real world was given you by God in loving exchange for the world\n<em>you</em> made and which <em>you</em> see. But take it from the hand of Christ and\nlook upon it. Its reality will make everything else invisible, for\nbeholding it is <em>total</em> perception. And as you look upon it, you will\nremember that it was always so. Nothingness will become invisible, for\nyou will at last have seen truly. Redeemed perception is easily\ntranslated into knowledge, for <em>only</em> perception is capable of error,\nand perception has never been. Being corrected, it gives place to\nknowledge, which is forever the <em>only</em> reality. The Atonement is but the\nway back to what was never lost. Your Father could not cease to love His\nSon.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>85</sup> If you did not feel guilty, you <em>could</em> not attack, for condemnation\nis the root of attack. It is the judgment of one mind by another as\n<em>unworthy</em> of love and <em>deserving</em> of punishment. But herein lies the\nsplit. For the mind that judges perceives itself as <em>separate</em> from the\nmind being judged, believing that by punishing another, <em>it</em> will escape\npunishment. All this is but the delusional attempt of the mind to deny\nitself and <em>escape the penalty of denial</em>. It is not an attempt to\n<em>relinquish</em> denial but to <em>hold on</em> to it. For it is guilt that has\nobscured the Father to you, and it is guilt that has driven you insane.</p>\n\n<p><sup>86</sup> The acceptance of guilt into the Mind of God’s Son was the beginning\nof the separation, as the acceptance of the Atonement is its end. The\nworld you see is the delusional system of those made mad by guilt. Look\ncarefully at this world, and you will realize that this is so. For this\nworld is the symbol of punishment, and all the laws which seem to govern\nit are the laws of death. Children are born into it through pain and in\npain. Their growth is attended by suffering, and they learn of sorrow\nand separation and death. Their minds are trapped in their brain, and\nits powers decline if their bodies are hurt. They seem to love, yet they\ndesert and are deserted. They appear to lose what they love, perhaps the\nmost insane belief of all. And their bodies wither and gasp and are laid\nin the ground and seem to be no more. Not one of them but has thought\nthat God is cruel.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> If this <em>were</em> the real world, God <em>would</em> be cruel. For no father\ncould subject his children to this as the price of salvation and <em>be</em>\nloving. <em>Love does not kill to save</em>. If it did, attack <em>would</em> be\nsalvation, and this is the <em>ego’s</em> interpretation, <em>not</em> God’s. Only the\nworld of guilt could demand this, for only the guilty could <em>conceive</em>\nof it. Adam’s “sin” could have touched none of you, had you not believed\nthat it was the <em>Father</em> Who drove him out of paradise. For in that\nbelief, the knowledge of the Father was lost, since only those who do\n<em>not</em> understand Him <em>could</em> believe it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> This world <em>is</em> a picture of the crucifixion of God’s Son. And until\nyou realize that God’s Son cannot <em>be</em> crucified, this is the world you\nwill see. Yet you will not realize this until you accept the eternal\nfact that God’s Son is <em>not guilty.</em> He <em>deserves</em> only love because he\nhas <em>given</em> only love. He cannot <em>be</em> condemned because he has never\ncondemned. The Atonement is the final lesson he need learn, for it\nteaches him that, never having sinned, he has no <em>need</em> of salvation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>89</sup> Long ago we said that the Holy Spirit shares the goal of all good\nteachers, whose ultimate aim is to make themselves unnecessary by\nteaching their pupils all they know. The Holy Spirit wills <em>only</em> this,\nfor sharing the Father’s love for His Son, He wills to remove <em>all</em>\nguilt from his mind that he may remember his Father in peace. For peace\nand guilt are antithetical, and the Father can be remembered <em>only</em> in\npeace. Love and guilt cannot coexist, and to accept one is to <em>deny</em> the\nother. Guilt hides Christ from your sight, for it is the denial of the\nblamelessness of God’s Son.</p>\n\n<p><sup>90</sup> In this strange world which you have made, the Son of God <em>has</em>\nsinned. How could you <em>see</em> him, then? By making him invisible, the\nworld of retribution rose in the black cloud of guilt which you\naccepted, and you hold it dear. For the blamelessness of Christ is the\nproof that the ego never was and can never be. Without guilt the ego\n<em>has</em> no life, and God’s Son <em>is</em> without guilt. As you look upon\nyourselves and judge what you do honestly, as you have been asked to do,\nyou may be tempted to wonder how you <em>can</em> be guiltless.</p>\n\n<p><sup>91</sup> Yet consider this: You are not guiltless in time, but in <em>eternity.</em>\nYou <em>have</em> “sinned” in the past, but there <em>is</em> no past. Always has <em>no</em>\ndirection. Time seems to go in one direction, but when you reach its\nend, it will roll up like a long carpet which has spread along the past\nbehind you and will disappear. As long as you believe the Son of God is\nguilty, you will walk along this carpet, believing that it leads to\ndeath. And the journey will seem long and cruel and senseless, for so it\n<em>is.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>92</sup> The journey which the Son of God has set himself is foolish indeed,\nbut the journey on which his Father sets him is one of release and joy.\nThe Father is <em>not</em> cruel, and His Son <em>cannot</em> hurt himself. The\nretaliation he fears and which he <em>sees</em> will never touch him, for\nalthough he believes in it, the Holy Spirit <em>knows</em> it is not true. The\nHoly Spirit stands at the <em>end</em> of time, where <em>you</em> must be because He\nis <em>with</em> you. He has <em>always</em> undone everything unworthy of the Son of\nGod, for such was His mission, given Him by God. And what God gives has\n<em>always</em> been.</p>\n\n<p><sup>93</sup> You will see me as you learn the Son of God is guiltless. He has\nalways sought his guiltlessness, and he has <em>found</em> it. For everyone is\nseeking to escape from the prison he has made, and the way to find\nrelease is not denied him. Being <em>in</em> him, he <em>has</em> found it. <em>When</em> he\nfinds it is only a matter of time, and time is but an illusion. For the\nSon of God is guiltless <em>now</em>, and the brightness of his purity shines\nuntouched forever in God’s Mind. God’s Son will <em>always</em> be as he was\ncreated. Deny <em>your</em> world and judge him not, for his eternal\nguiltlessness is in the mind of his Father, and protects him forever.</p>\n\n<p><sup>94</sup> When you have accepted the Atonement for yourselves, you will realize\nthat there <em>is</em> no guilt in God’s Son. And <em>only</em> as you look upon him\nas guiltless can you understand his oneness. For the idea of guilt\nbrings a belief in condemnation of one by another, projecting separation\nin place of unity. You can condemn only <em>yourself</em>, and by so doing, you\ncannot know that you <em>are</em> God’s Son. You have denied the condition of\nhis Being, which is his perfect blamelessness. Out of love he was\ncreated, and in love he abides. Goodness and mercy have always followed\nhim, for he has always extended the love of his Father.</p>\n\n<p><sup>95</sup> As you perceive the holy companions who travel with you, you will\nrealize that there <em>is</em> no journey, but only an awakening. The Son of\nGod, who sleepeth not, has kept faith with his Father <em>for</em> you. There\nis no road to travel on and no time to travel through. For God waits not\nfor His Son in time, being forever unwilling to be without him. And so\nit has always been. Let the holiness of God’s Son shine away the cloud\nof guilt that darkens your mind, and by accepting his purity as yours,\nlearn of him that it <em>is</em> yours.</p>\n\n<p><sup>96</sup> You are invulnerable <em>because</em> you are guiltless. You can hold on to\nthe past <em>only</em> through guilt. For guilt establishes that you will be\npunished for what you have done and thus depends on one-dimensional\ntime, proceeding from past to future. No one who believes this can\nunderstand what <em>always</em> means. And therefore guilt <em>must</em> deprive you\nof the appreciation of eternity. You are immortal <em>because</em> you are\neternal and always <em>must</em> be now. Guilt, then, is a way of holding past\nand future in your minds to ensure the ego’s continuity. For if what has\nbeen <em>will</em> be punished, the ego’s continuity is guaranteed. Yet the\nguarantee of your continuity is God’s, not the ego’s. And immortality is\nthe opposite of time, for time passes away, while immortality is\nconstant.</p>\n\n<p><sup>97</sup> Accepting the Atonement teaches you what immortality <em>is</em>, for by\naccepting your guiltlessness, you learn that the past has never been,\nand so the future is needless. The future, in time, is always associated\nwith expiation, and <em>only</em> guilt could induce a sense of <em>need</em> for\nexpiation. Accepting the guiltlessness of the Son of God as <em>yours</em> is\ntherefore God’s way of reminding you of His Son and what he is in truth.\nFor God has never condemned His Son, and being guiltless, he <em>is</em>\neternal.</p>\n\n<p><sup>98</sup> You cannot dispel guilt by making it real and <em>then</em> atoning for it.\nThis is the ego’s plan, which it offers <em>instead</em> of dispelling it. The\nego believes in atonement through <em>attack</em>, being fully committed to the\ninsane notion that attack <em>is</em> salvation. And you who cherish guilt must\n<em>also</em> believe it, for how else but by identifying <em>with</em> the ego could\nyou hold dear what you do not want?</p>\n\n<p><sup>99</sup> The ego teaches you to attack yourself <em>because</em> you are guilty, and\nthis must <em>increase</em> the guilt, for guilt is the <em>result</em> of attack. In\nthe ego’s teaching, then, there <em>is</em> no escape from guilt. For attack\nmakes guilt real, and if it is real, there <em>is</em> no way to overcome it.\nThe Holy Spirit dispels it simply through the calm recognition that it\nhas never been. As He looks upon the guiltless Son of God, he <em>knows</em>\nthis is true. And being true for <em>you</em>, you <em>cannot</em> attack yourself,\nfor without guilt, attack is impossible. You, then, <em>are</em> saved because\nGod’s Son is guiltless. And being wholly pure, you <em>are</em> invulnerable.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>3</sup> The darkest of your hidden cornerstones holds your belief in guilt\nfrom your awareness. For in that dark and secret place is the\nrealization that you have betrayed God’s Son by condemning him to death.\nYou do not even suspect this murderous but insane idea lies hidden\nthere, for the ego’s destructive urge is so intense that nothing short\nof the crucifixion of God’s Son can ultimately satisfy it. It does not\nknow who the Son of God is because it is blind. Yet let it perceive\nguiltlessness anywhere, and it will try to destroy it because it is\nafraid.</p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup> Much of the ego’s strange behavior is directly attributable to its\ndefinition of guilt. To the ego, <em>the guiltless are guilty</em>. Those who\ndo not attack are its “enemies” because, by not valuing its\ninterpretation of salvation, they are in an excellent position <em>to let\nit go</em>. They have approached the darkest and deepest cornerstone in the\nego’s foundation, and while the ego can withstand your raising all else\nto question, it guards this one secret with its life, for its existence\n<em>does</em> depend on keeping this secret. So it is this secret that we must\nlook upon calmly, for the ego cannot protect you against truth, and in\n<em>its</em> presence the ego is dispelled.</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> In the calm light of truth, let us recognize that you believe you\n<em>have</em> crucified God’s Son. You have not admitted to this “terrible”\nsecret because you <em>still</em> wish to crucify him if you could <em>find</em> him.\nYet the wish has hidden him from you because it is very fearful, and you\nare <em>afraid</em> to find him. You have handled this wish to kill <em>yourself</em>\nby <em>not knowing</em> who you are and identifying with something <em>else</em>. You\nhave projected guilt blindly and indiscriminately, but you have <em>not</em>\nuncovered its source. For the ego <em>does</em> want to kill you, and if you\nidentify <em>with</em> it, you must believe <em>its</em> goal is <em>yours.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> We once said that the crucifixion is the symbol of the ego. When it\nwas confronted with the <em>real</em> guiltlessness of God’s Son, it <em>did</em>\nattempt to kill him, and the reason it gave was that guiltlessness is\nblasphemous to God. To the ego <em>the ego</em> is god, and guiltlessness\n<em>must</em> be interpreted as the final guilt which fully justifies murder.\nYou do not yet understand that all your fear of this course stems\nultimately from this interpretation, but if you will consider your\nreactions to it, you will become increasingly convinced that this is so.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> This course has explicitly stated that its goal for you is happiness\nand peace. Yet you are <em>afraid</em> of it. You have been told again and\nagain that it will make you free, yet you react as if it is trying to\nimprison you. Most of the time you dismiss it, but you do <em>not</em> dismiss\nthe <em>ego’s</em> thought system. You have <em>seen</em> its results and you <em>still</em>\nlack faith in it. You <em>must</em>, then, believe that by <em>not</em> learning the\ncourse, you are <em>protecting</em> yourself. And you do not realize that it is\nonly your guiltlessness which <em>can</em> protect you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> The Atonement has always been interpreted as the release from guilt,\nand this is correct if it is understood. Yet even when I have\ninterpreted it <em>for</em> you, you have rejected it and have <em>not</em> accepted\nit for yourself. You have recognized the futility of the ego and its\nofferings, but though you do not want the ego, you do not look upon the\nalternative with gladness. You are <em>afraid</em> of redemption, and you\nbelieve it will kill you. Make no mistake about the depth of your fear.\nFor you believe that in the presence of truth you will turn on yourself\nand destroy yourself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> Little children, this is not so. Your “guilty secret” is nothing, and\nif you will but bring it to the light, the light will dispel it. And\nthen no dark cloud will remain between you and the remembrance of your\nFather, for you will remember His guiltless Son, who did not die because\nhe is immortal. And you will see that you were redeemed <em>with</em> him and\nhave never been separated <em>from</em> him. In this understanding lies your\nremembering, for it is the recognition of love <em>without</em> fear. There\nwill be great joy in Heaven on your homecoming, and the joy will be\n<em>yours</em>. For the redeemed son of man <em>is</em> the guiltless Son of God, and\nto recognize him <em>is</em> your redemption.</p>\n\n",

You may also think that it would be easy\nenough for the Holy Spirit to show it to you and dispel it, <em>without</em>\nthe need for you to raise it to awareness yourself. Yet there is one\nmore complication which you have interposed between yourself and the\nAtonement, which you do not yet realize. We have said that no one will\ncountenance fear if he <em>recognizes</em> it. Yet in your disordered state,\nyou are <em>not</em> afraid of fear. You do not like it, but it is not your\ndesire to attack which <em>really</em> frightens you. You are not seriously\ndisturbed by your hostility. You keep it hidden because you are <em>more</em>\nafraid of what it covers.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> You could look even upon the ego’s darkest cornerstone <em>without</em> fear\nif you did not believe that, <em>without</em> the ego, you would find within\nyourself something you fear even more. You are <em>not</em> afraid of\ncrucifixion. Your real terror is of <em>redemption.</em> Under the ego’s dark\nfoundation is the memory of God, and it is of <em>this</em> that you are really\nafraid. For this memory would <em>instantly</em> restore you to your proper\nplace, and it is this place that you have sought to <em>leave.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> Your fear of attack is nothing compared to your fear of love. You\nwould be willing to look even upon your savage wish to kill God’s Son if\nyou did not believe that it <em>saves</em> you from love. For this wish\n<em>caused</em> the separation. You have protected it because you do not <em>want</em>\nthe separation healed, and you realize that, by <em>removing</em> the dark\ncloud that obscures it, your love for your Father would impel you to\nanswer His call and leap into Heaven. You believe that attack is\nsalvation to prevent you from <em>this.</em> For still deeper than the ego’s\nfoundation, and much stronger than it will ever be, is your intense and\nburning love of God, and His for you. This is what you <em>really</em> want to\nhide.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> In honesty, is it not harder for you to say “I love” than “I hate”?\nYou associate love with weakness and hatred with strength, and your own\n<em>real</em> power seems to you as your real <em>weakness.</em> For you could not\ncontrol your joyous response to the call of love if you heard it, and\nthe whole world you think you control <em>would</em> vanish. The Holy Spirit,\nthen, seems to be attacking your fortress, for you would shut out God,\nand He does not will to <em>be</em> excluded.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> You have built your whole insane belief system because you think you\nwould be helpless in God’s Presence, and you would <em>save</em> yourself from\nHis love because you think it would crush you into nothingness. You are\nafraid it would sweep you away from yourself and make you little. For\nyou believe that magnitude lies in defiance and that attack is grandeur.\nYou think you have made a world which God would destroy; and by loving\nHim, which you <em>do</em>, you would throw this world away, which you <em>would</em>.\nTherefore, you have used the world to <em>cover</em> your love, and the deeper\nyou go into the blackness of the ego’s foundation, the closer you come\nto the love that is hidden there. <em>And it is this that frightens you.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> You can accept insanity because you made it, but you cannot accept\nlove because you did <em>not</em>. You would rather be slaves of the\ncrucifixion than Sons of God in redemption. For your <em>individual</em> death\nis more valued than your living oneness, and what is <em>given</em> you is not\nso dear as what <em>you</em> made. You are more afraid of God than of the ego,\nand love cannot enter where it is not welcome. But hatred can, for it\nenters of <em>its</em> will and cares not for yours.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> The reason you must look upon your delusions and not keep them hidden\nis that they do <em>not</em> rest on their own foundation. In concealment they\nappear to do so, and thus they <em>seem</em> to be self-sustained. This is the\nfundamental illusion on which they rest. For <em>beneath</em> them and\nconcealed as long as <em>they</em> are hidden is the loving mind that <em>thought</em>\nit made them in anger. And the pain in this mind is so apparent when it\nis uncovered that its need of healing cannot <em>be</em> denied. Not all the\ntricks and games you offer it can heal it, for here is the <em>real</em>\ncrucifixion of God’s Son.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> And yet he is <em>not</em> crucified. Here is both his pain <em>and</em> his\nhealing, for the Holy Spirit’s vision is merciful, and His remedy is\nquick. Do not <em>hide</em> suffering from His sight, but bring it gladly to\nHim. Lay before His eternal sanity <em>all</em> your hurt, and <em>let</em> Him heal\nyou. Do not leave any spot of pain hidden from His light, and search\nyour minds carefully for any thoughts which you may fear to uncover. For\nHe will heal every little thought which you have kept to hurt you and\ncleanse it of its littleness, restoring it to the magnitude of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> Beneath all your grandiosity, which you hold so dear, is your real\ncall for help. For you call for love to your Father as your Father calls\nyou to Himself. In that place which you have hidden, you will only to\nunite with the Father in loving remembrance of Him. You will find this\nplace of truth as you see it in your brothers, for though they may\ndeceive themselves, like you they long for the grandeur that is in them.\nAnd perceiving it you will welcome it, and it will be <em>yours</em>. For\ngrandeur is the <em>right</em> of God’s Son, and <em>no</em> illusions can satisfy him\nor save him from what he <em>is.</em> Only his love is real, and he will be\ncontent <em>only</em> with his reality.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> Save him from his illusions that you may accept the magnitude of your\nFather in peace and joy. But exempt no one from your love, or you will\nbe hiding a dark place in your mind where the Holy Spirit is not\nwelcome. And you will exempt <em>yourself</em> from His healing power, for by\nnot offering total love, you will not be healed completely. Healing must\nbe as complete as fear, for love cannot enter where there is one spot of\nfear to mar its welcome.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> You who prefer specialness to sanity could not obtain it in your\nright minds. You were at peace until you asked for special favor. And\nGod did not give it, for the request was alien to Him, and you could not\nask this of a Father Who truly loved His Son. Therefore you made of Him\nan unloving father, demanding of Him what only such a father could give.\nAnd the peace of God’s Son was shattered, for he no longer understood\nhis Father. He feared what he had made, but still more did he fear his\n<em>real</em> Father, having attacked his own glorious equality with Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> In peace he needed nothing and asked for nothing. In war he\n<em>demanded</em> everything and <em>found</em> nothing. For how could the gentleness\nof love respond to his demands <em>except</em> by departing in peace and\nreturning to the Father? If the Son did not wish to remain in peace, he\ncould not remain at all. For a darkened mind cannot live in the light,\nand it must seek a place of darkness where it can believe it is where it\nis not. God did not allow this to happen. Yet you <em>demanded</em> that it\nhappen and therefore believed that it was so.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> To “single out” is to “make alone” and thus <em>make lonely</em>. God did\nnot do this to you. Could He set you apart, <em>knowing</em> that your peace\nlies in His Oneness? He denied you only your request for pain, for\nsuffering is not of His creation. Having <em>given</em> you creation, He could\nnot take it <em>from</em> you. He could but answer your insane request with a\nsane answer which would abide with you in your insanity. [And this He\ndid. No one who hears His answer but will give up insanity.] For His\nanswer is the reference point <em>beyond</em> illusions from which you can look\nback on them and <em>see</em> them as insane. But seek <em>this</em> place, and you\n<em>will</em> find it, for love is in you and will lead you there.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>23</sup> And now the reason why you are afraid of this course should be\napparent. For this is a course on love because it is about <em>you</em>. You\nhave been told that your function in this world is healing, and your\nfunction in Heaven is creating. The ego teaches that your function on\nearth is destruction and that you have no function at all in Heaven. It\nwould thus destroy you here and bury you here, leaving you no\ninheritance except the dust out of which it thinks you were made. As\nlong as it is reasonably satisfied with you, as its reasoning goes, it\noffers you oblivion. When it becomes overtly savage, it offers you hell.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> Yet neither oblivion nor hell is as unacceptable to you as Heaven.\nFor your definition of Heaven <em>is</em> hell and oblivion, and the <em>real</em>\nHeaven is the greatest threat you think you could experience. For hell\nand oblivion are ideas which <em>you</em> made up, and you are bent on\ndemonstrating their reality to establish <em>yours</em>. If <em>their</em> reality is\nquestioned, you believe that <em>yours</em> is. For you believe that <em>attack</em>\nis your reality and that your destruction is the final proof that you\nwere <em>right</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> Under the circumstances, would it not be more <em>desirable</em> to have\nbeen wrong, even apart from the fact that you <em>were</em> wrong? While it\ncould perhaps be argued that death suggests there <em>was</em> life, no one\nwould claim that it proves there <em>is</em> life. Even the past life which\ndeath might indicate could only have been futile if it must come to this\nand <em>needs</em> this to prove that it was. You question Heaven, but you do\nnot question <em>this</em>. You could heal and be healed if you <em>did</em> question\nit. And even though you know not Heaven, might it not be more desirable\nthan death? You have been as selective in your questioning as in your\nperception. An open mind is more honest than this.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> The ego has a very strange notion of time, and it is with this notion\nthat your questioning might well begin. The ego invests heavily in the\npast and in the end believes that the past is the <em>only</em> aspect of time\nthat is meaningful. You will remember that we said its emphasis on guilt\nenables it to ensure its continuity by making the future <em>like</em> the past\nand thus avoiding the present. By the notion of <em>paying</em> for the past in\nthe future, the past becomes the <em>determiner</em> of the future, making them\ncontinuous <em>without</em> an intervening present. For the ego uses the\npresent <em>only</em> as a brief transition to the future, in which it brings\nthe past <em>to</em> the future by interpreting the present in <em>past</em> terms.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> <em>Now</em> has no meaning to the ego. The present merely reminds it of\npast hurts, and it reacts to the present as if it <em>were</em> the past. The\nego cannot tolerate <em>release</em> from the past, and although the past is no\nmore, the ego tries to preserve its image by responding <em>as if</em> it were\npresent. Thus it dictates reactions to those you meet now from a <em>past</em>\nreference point, obscuring their present reality. In effect, if you\nfollow the ego’s dictates, you will react to your brothers as though\nthey were someone <em>else</em>, and this will surely prevent you from\nperceiving them as they <em>are</em>. And you will receive messages from them\nout of your <em>own</em> past because, by making it real in the present, you\nare forbidding yourself to <em>let it go.</em> You thus deny yourself the\nmessage of release that every brother offers you <em>now</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> The shadowy figures from the past are precisely what you must\n<em>escape</em>. For they are not real and have no hold over you unless you\nbring them <em>with</em> you. They carry the spots of pain in your minds,\ndirecting you to attack in the present in retaliation for a past that is\nno more. And this decision is one of <em>future</em> pain. Unless you learn\nthat past pain is delusional, you are choosing a future of illusions and\nlosing the endless opportunities which you could find for release in the\npresent. The ego would <em>preserve</em> your nightmares and <em>prevent</em> you from\nawakening and understanding that they <em>are</em> past.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> Would you <em>recognize</em> a holy encounter if you are merely perceiving\nit as a meeting with your own past? For you are meeting no one, and the\n<em>sharing</em> of salvation, which <em>makes</em> the encounter holy, is excluded\nfrom your sight. The Holy Spirit teaches that you always meet <em>yourself</em>\nand the encounter is holy because <em>you</em> are. The ego teaches that you\nalways encounter your past, and because your dreams <em>were</em> not holy, the\nfuture <em>cannot</em> be, and the present is without meaning. It is evident\nthat the Holy Spirit’s perception of time is the exact opposite of the\nego’s. The reason is equally clear, for they perceive the goal of time\nas diametrically opposed.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> The Holy Spirit interprets time’s purpose as rendering the need for\nit unnecessary. Thus does He regard the function of time as temporary,\nserving only His teaching function, which is temporary by definition.\n<em>His</em> emphasis is therefore on the only aspect of time which <em>can</em>\nextend to the infinite, for <em>now</em> is the closest approximation of\neternity which this world offers. It is in the <em>reality</em> of now, without\npast <em>or</em> future, that the beginning of the appreciation of eternity\nlies. For only now is <em>here</em>, and <em>it</em> presents the opportunities for\nthe holy encounters in which salvation can be found.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> The ego, on the other hand, regards the function of time as one of\nextending itself <em>in place</em> of eternity, for like the Holy Spirit, the\nego interprets the goal of time as its own. The continuity of past and\nfuture under <em>its</em> direction is the only purpose the ego perceives in\ntime, and it closes over the present so that no gap in its <em>own</em>\ncontinuity can occur. <em>Its</em> continuity, then, would <em>keep</em> you in time,\nwhile the Holy Spirit would release you <em>from</em> it. It is <em>His</em>\ninterpretation of the means of salvation which you must learn to accept\nif you would share His goal of salvation for you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> You too will interpret the function of time as you interpret yours.\nIf you accept your function in the world of time as healing, you will\nemphasize <em>only</em> the aspect of time in which healing can occur. For\nhealing <em>cannot</em> be accomplished in the past and <em>must</em> be accomplished\nin the present to release the <em>future.</em> This interpretation ties the\nfuture to the <em>present</em> and extends the present rather than the past.\nBut if you interpret your function as destruction, you will lose sight\nof the present and hold on to the past to <em>ensure</em> a destructive future.\nAnd time <em>will</em> be as you interpret it, for of itself it is <em>nothing</em>.</p>\n\n",

The other has many forms, for the content of individual\nillusions differs greatly. Yet they have one thing in common—they are\nall insane. They are made of sights which are <em>not</em> seen and sounds\nwhich are <em>not</em> heard. They make up a private world which <em>cannot</em> be\nshared. For they are meaningful <em>only</em> to their maker, and so they have\nno meaning at all. In this world their maker moves alone, for only he\nperceives them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> Each one peoples his world with figures from his individual past, and\nit is because of this that private worlds <em>do</em> differ. Yet the figures\nthat he sees were <em>never</em> real, for they are made up only of <em>his</em>\nreactions to his brothers and do not include their reactions to <em>him</em>.\nTherefore he does not <em>see</em> that he made them and that they are not\nwhole. For these figures have no witnesses, being perceived in one\nseparate mind only.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> It is <em>through</em> these strange and shadowy figures that the insane\nrelate to their insane world. For they see <em>only</em> those who remind them\nof these images, and it is to <em>them</em> that they relate. Thus do they\ncommunicate with those who are not there, and it is <em>they</em> who answer\nthem, and no one hears their answer save him who called upon them, and\nhe alone believes they answered him. Projection makes perception, and\nyou <em>cannot</em> see beyond it. Again and again have men attacked each other\nbecause they saw in them a shadow figure in their <em>own</em> private world.\nAnd thus it is that you <em>must</em> attack yourself first, for what you\nattack is <em>not</em> in others. Its only reality is in your <em>own</em> mind, and\nby attacking others, you are literally attacking what is <em>not there.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> The delusional can be very destructive, for they do not recognize\nthat they have condemned <em>themselves</em>.

For love cannot abide in a\nworld apart, where when it comes it is not recognized. If you see your\nown hatred <em>as</em> your brother, you are not seeing <em>him.</em> Everyone draws\nnigh unto what he loves and recoils from what he fears. And you react\nwith fear to love and draw away from it. Yet fear <em>attracts</em> you, and\nbelieving it <em>is</em> love, you call it to yourself. Your private world is\nfilled with the figures of fear you have invited into it, and all the\nlove your brothers offer you, <em>you do not see</em>. As you look with open\neyes upon your world, it <em>must</em> occur to you that you have withdrawn\ninto insanity.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> You see what is not there, and you hear what is soundless. Your\nbehavioral manifestations of emotions are the <em>opposite</em> of what the\nemotions are. You communicate with no one, and you are as isolated from\nreality as if you were alone in all the universe. In your madness, you\noverlook reality <em>completely</em>, and you see only your <em>own</em> split mind\neverywhere you look. God calls you and you do not hear, for you are\npreoccupied with your own voice. And the vision of Christ is not in your\nsight, for you look upon yourself <em>alone</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> Little children, would you offer <em>this</em> to your Father? For if you\noffer it to yourself, you <em>are</em> offering it to Him. And He will <em>not</em>\nreturn it, for it is unworthy of you because it is unworthy of Him. Yet\nHe <em>would</em> release you from it and set you free. His sane answer tells\nyou that what you have offered yourself is not true, but <em>His</em> offering\nto you has never changed. You who know not what you do <em>can</em> learn what\ninsanity is and look beyond it. It is given you to learn how to <em>deny</em>\ninsanity and come forth from your private world in peace.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> You will see all that you denied in your brothers <em>because</em> you\ndenied it in yourself. For you will love them, and by drawing nigh unto\nthem, you will draw them to yourself, perceiving them as witnesses to\nyour reality, which you share with God. I am with <em>them</em> as I am with\n<em>you</em>, and we will draw them from their private worlds, for as we are\nunited, so would we unite with them. The Father welcomes all of us in\ngladness, and gladness is what <em>we</em> should offer <em>Him</em>. For every Son of\nGod is given you to whom God gave <em>Himself.</em> And it is God to Whom you\nmust offer them to recognize His gift to <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> Vision depends on light, and you cannot see in darkness.

Yet for this, light <em>must</em> be excluded.\nDreams disappear when light has come and you can <em>see</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> Do not seek vision through <em>your</em> eyes, for you <em>made</em> your way of\nseeing that you might see in darkness, and in this you are deceived.\n<em>Beyond</em> this darkness and yet still <em>within</em> you is the vision of\nChrist, Who looks on all in light. Your vision comes from fear, as His\nfrom love. And He sees <em>for</em> you as your witness to the real world. He\nis the Holy Spirit’s manifestation, looking always on the real world and\ncalling forth its witnesses and drawing them <em>unto</em> you. For He loves\nwhat He sees within you, and He would <em>extend</em> it. And He will not\nreturn unto the Father until He has extended your perception even unto\nHim. And there perception is no more, for He has returned you to the\nFather with Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> You have but two emotions, and one you made and one was given you.\nEach is a <em>way of seeing</em>, and different worlds arise from their\ndifferent visions. See through the vision that is given you, for through\nChrist’s vision He beholds Himself. And seeing what He is, He knows His\nFather. Beyond your darkest dreams, He sees God’s guiltless Son within\nyou, shining in perfect radiance, which is undimmed by your dreams. And\nthis <em>you</em> will see as you look with Him, for His vision is His gift of\nlove to you, given Him of the Father <em>for</em> you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> The Holy Spirit is the light in which Christ stands revealed. And all\nwho would behold Him can see Him, for they have <em>asked</em> for light. Nor\nwill they see Him <em>alone</em>, for He is no more alone than they are.\nBecause they saw the Son, they have risen in Him to the Father. And all\nthis will they understand because they looked within and saw beyond the\ndarkness the Christ in them and <em>recognized</em> Him. In the sanity of His\nvision, they looked upon themselves with love, seeing themselves as the\nHoly Spirit sees them. And <em>with</em> this vision of the truth in them came\nall the beauty of the world to shine upon them.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>45</sup> To perceive truly is to be aware of <em>all</em> reality through the\nawareness of your own. But for this <em>no</em> illusions can rise to meet your\nsight, for <em>all</em> reality leaves no room for <em>any</em> error. This means that\nyou perceive a brother only as you see him <em>now</em>. His past has <em>no</em>\nreality in the present, and you <em>cannot</em> see it. <em>Your</em> past reactions\nto him are <em>also</em> not there, and if it is to them that you react <em>now</em>,\nyou see but an image of him which you made and cherish <em>instead</em> of him.\nIn your questioning of illusions, ask yourself if it is <em>really</em> sane to\nperceive what <em>was now.</em> If you remember the past as you look upon your\nbrother, you will be unable to perceive the reality that is <em>now</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> You consider it “natural” to use your past experience as the\nreference point from which to <em>judge</em> the present. Yet this is\n<em>unnatural</em> because it is delusional. When you have learned to look upon\neveryone with <em>no reference at all</em> to the past, either his or yours as\nyou perceived it, you will be able to learn from what you see <em>now</em>. For\nthe past can cast no shadow to darken the present <em>unless you are\nafraid</em> <em>of light.</em> And only if you are would you choose to bring this\ndarkness <em>with</em> you, and by holding it in your minds, see it as a dark\ncloud that shrouds your brothers and conceals their reality from your\nsight.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> <em>This darkness is in you</em>. The Christ revealed to you <em>now</em> has no\npast, for He is changeless, and in <em>His</em> changelessness lies <em>your</em>\nrelease. For if He is as He was created, there is no guilt in Him. No\ncloud of guilt has risen to obscure Him, and He stands revealed in\neveryone you meet because you see Him through <em>Himself</em>. To be born\nagain is to <em>let the past go</em> and look without condemnation upon the\npresent. For the cloud which obscures God’s Son to you <em>is</em> the past,\nand if you would have it past <em>and gone</em>, you must not see it <em>now</em>. If\nyou see it now in your delusions, it has <em>not</em> gone from you, although\nit is not there.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> Time can release as well as imprison, depending on whose\ninterpretation of it you use. Past, present, and future are not\ncontinuous unless you <em>force</em> continuity on them. You can <em>perceive</em>\nthem as continuous and make them so for <em>you.</em> But do not be deceived\nand then believe that this is how it <em>is</em>, for to believe that reality\nis what you would <em>have</em> it be according to your use for it <em>is</em>\ndelusional. You would destroy time’s continuity by breaking it into\npast, present, and future <em>for your own purposes</em>. You would anticipate\nthe future on the basis of your past experience and plan for it\naccordingly. Yet by doing so, you are <em>aligning</em> past and future and not\nallowing the miracle, which could intervene <em>between</em> them, to free you\nto be born again.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> The miracle enables you to see your brother <em>without</em> his past and so\nperceive <em>him</em> as born again. His errors <em>are</em> all past, and by\nperceiving him without them, you are <em>releasing</em> him. And since his past\nis <em>yours</em>, you <em>share</em> in this release. Let no dark cloud out of <em>your</em>\npast obscure him from you, for truth lies <em>only</em> in the present, and you\nwill find it if you seek it there. You have looked for it where it is\n<em>not</em> and therefore have not found it. Learn, then, to seek it where it\n<em>is</em>, and it will dawn on eyes that see. Your past was made in anger,\nand if you use it to attack the present, you will not <em>see</em> the freedom\nthat the present holds. Judgment and condemnation are <em>behind</em> you, and\nunless you bring them <em>with</em> you, you will see that you <em>are</em> free of\nthem.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> Look lovingly upon the present, for it holds the <em>only</em> things that\nare forever true. All healing lies within it because <em>its</em> continuity is\nreal. It extends to all aspects of consciousness <em>at the same time</em> and\nthus enables them to reach <em>each other.</em> The present is before time was\nand will be when time is no more. In it is everything that is eternal,\nand they are one. Their continuity is timeless, and their communication\nis unbroken, for they are not separated by the past. Only the past <em>can</em>\nseparate, and <em>it</em> is nowhere.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> The present offers you your brothers in the light that would unite\nyou with them and free you <em>from</em> the past. Would you, then, hold the\npast <em>against</em> them? For if you do, you are choosing to remain in the\ndarkness that is not there and refusing to accept the light that is\noffered you. For the light of perfect vision is freely given as it is\nfreely received and can be accepted only <em>without limit</em>. In this one\nstill dimension of time, which does not change and where there is no\nsight of what you were, you look at Christ and call His witnesses to\nshine on you <em>because you called them forth</em>. And <em>they</em> will not deny\nthe truth in you because you looked for it in them and <em>found</em> it there.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> Now is the time of salvation, for now is the <em>release</em> from time.\nReach out to all your brothers and touch them with the touch of Christ.\nIn timeless union with them is <em>your</em> continuity, unbroken because it is\nwholly shared. God’s guiltless Son is <em>only</em> light. There is no darkness\nin him anywhere, for he is whole. Call all your brothers to witness to\nhis wholeness, as I am calling you to join with me. Every voice has a\npart in the song of redemption, the hymn of gladness and thanksgiving\nfor the light to the Creator of light. The holy light that shines forth\nfrom God’s Son is the witness that his light is of his Father.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> Shine on your brothers in remembrance of your Creator, for you will\nremember Him as you call forth the witnesses to His creation. Those whom\nyou heal bear witness to <em>your</em> healing, for in their wholeness you will\nsee your own. And as your hymns of praise and gladness rise to your\nCreator, He will return your thanks in His clear answer to your call.\nFor it can never be that His Son called upon Him and remained\nunanswered. His call to you is but your call to Him. And <em>in</em> Him you\nare answered by His peace.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> Children of light, you know not that the light is in you. Yet you\nwill find it through its witnesses, for having <em>given</em> light to them,\nthey will <em>return</em> it. Everyone you see in light brings <em>your</em> light\ncloser to your <em>own</em> awareness. Love always leads to love. The sick who\nask for love are grateful for it, and in their joy, they shine with holy\nthanks. And this they offer you, who <em>gave</em> them joy. They are your\nguides to joy, for having received it of you, they would keep it. You\nhave established them as guides to peace, for you have made it manifest\nin them. And <em>seeing</em> it, its beauty calls <em>you</em> home.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> There is a light which this world cannot give. Yet <em>you</em> can give it,\nas it was given you. And as you give it, it shines forth to call you\nfrom the world and follow it. For this light will attract you as nothing\nin this world can do. And you will lay aside the world and find another.\nThis other world is bright with love, which <em>you</em> have given it. And\nhere will everything remind you of your Father and His Holy Son. Light\nis unlimited and spreads across this world in quiet joy. All those you\nbrought with you will shine on you, and you will shine on them in\ngratitude because they brought you here. Your light will join with\ntheirs in power so compelling that it will draw the others out of\ndarkness as you look on them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Awakening unto Christ is following the laws of love of your free will\nand out of quiet recognition of the truth in them. The attraction of\nlight must draw you willingly, and willingness is signified by <em>giving.</em>\nThose who accept love of you become your willing witnesses to the love\nyou gave them, and it is <em>they</em> who hold it out to <em>you</em>. In sleep you\nare alone, and your awareness is narrowed to yourself. And that is why\nthe nightmares come. You dream of isolation <em>because</em> your eyes are\nclosed. You do not <em>see</em> your brothers, and in the darkness you cannot\nlook upon the light you gave to them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> And yet the laws of love are not suspended because you sleep. And you\nhave followed them through all your nightmares and have been faithful in\nyour giving, for you were <em>not</em> alone. Even in sleep has Christ\nprotected you, ensuring the real world for you when you wake. In <em>your</em>\nname He has given <em>for</em> you and given <em>you</em> the gifts He gave. God’s Son\nis still as loving as his Father. Continuous <em>with</em> his Father, he has\nno past apart from Him. So he has never ceased to be his Father’s\nwitness <em>and his own</em>. Although he slept, Christ’s vision did not leave\nhim. And so it is that he can call unto himself the witnesses that teach\nhim that he never slept.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>58</sup> Sit quietly and look upon the world you see, and tell yourself,</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> <em>The real world is not like this. It has no buildings, and there are\nno streets where people walk alone and separate. There are no stores\nwhere people buy an endless list of things they do not need. It is not\nlit with artificial light, and night comes not upon it. There is no day\nthat brightens and grows dim. There is no loss. Nothing is there but\nshines, and shines forever.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> The world <em>you</em> see must be <em>denied</em>, for sight of it is costing you\na different kind of vision. <em>You cannot see both worlds</em>, for each of\nthem involves a different kind of seeing and depends on what you\ncherish. The sight of one is possible <em>because</em> you have denied the\nother. Both are not true, yet either one will seem as real to you as the\namount to which you hold it dear. And yet their power is <em>not</em> the same\nbecause their real attraction to you is unequal.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> You do not really want the world you see, for it has disappointed you\nsince time began. The homes you built have never sheltered you. The\nroads you made have led you nowhere, and no city that you built has\nwithstood the crumbling assault of time. Nothing you made but has the\nmark of death upon it. Hold it not dear, for it is old and tired and\nready to return to dust even as you made it. This aching world has not\nthe power to touch the living world at all. You could not give it that,\nand so although you turn in sadness from it, you cannot find in <em>it</em> the\nroad that leads away from it into another world.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> Yet the real world has the power to touch you even here <em>because you\nlove it.</em> And what you call with love <em>will</em> come to you. Love <em>always</em>\nanswers, being unable to deny a call for help or not to hear the cries\nof pain that rise to it from every part of this strange world you made\nbut do not want. The only effort you need make to give this world away\nin glad exchange for what you did not make is willingness to learn <em>the\none you made is false.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> You <em>have</em> been wrong about the world because you have misjudged\n<em>yourself</em>. From such a twisted reference point what <em>could</em> you see?\nAll vision starts <em>with the perceiver</em> who judges what is true and what\nis false. And what he judges false <em>he does not see.</em> You who would\njudge reality <em>cannot</em> see it, for whenever judgment enters, reality has\nslipped away. The out of mind is out of sight because what is denied is\nthere but is not <em>recognized</em>. Christ is still there, although you know\nHim not. His Being does not depend upon your recognition. He lives\nwithin you in the quiet present and waits for you to leave the past\nbehind and enter into the world He holds out to you in love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> No one in this distracted world but has seen some glimpses of the\nother world about him. Yet while he still lays value on his own, he will\n<em>deny</em> the vision of the other world, maintaining that he loves what he\nloves not and following not the road that love points out. Love leads so\ngladly! And as you follow Him, you will rejoice that you have found His\ncompany and learned of Him the joyful journey home. You wait but for\n<em>yourself.</em> To give this sad world over and exchange your errors for the\npeace of God is but <em>your</em> will. And Christ will <em>always</em> offer you the\nWill of God in recognition that you share it with Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> It is God’s Will that nothing touch His Son except Himself, and\nnothing else comes nigh unto him. He is as safe from pain as God\nHimself, Who watches over him in everything. The world about him shines\nwith love because God placed him in Himself where pain is not and love\nsurrounds him without end or flaw. Disturbance of his peace can never\nbe. In perfect sanity he looks on love, for it is all about him and\nwithin him. He <em>must</em> deny the world of pain the instant he perceives\nthe arms of love around him. And from this point of safety, he looks\nquietly about him and recognizes that the world is one with him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> The peace of God passeth your understanding <em>only</em> in the past. Yet\nhere it <em>is</em>, and you can understand it <em>now</em>. God loves His Son\nforever, and His Son <em>returns</em> his Father’s love forever. The real world\nis the way that leads you to remembrance of this one thing that is\nwholly true and wholly <em>yours</em>. For all else you have lent yourself in\ntime, and it will fade. But this one thing is <em>always</em> yours, being the\ngift of God unto His Son. Your <em>one</em> reality was given you, and by it\nGod created you as one with Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> You will first dream of peace and then awaken to it. Your first\nexchange of what you made for what you want is the exchange of\nnightmares for the happy dreams of love. In these lie your true\nperceptions, for the Holy Spirit corrects the world of dreams, where\n<em>all</em> perception is. Knowledge needs no correction. Yet the dreams of\nlove lead <em>unto</em> knowledge. In them you see nothing fearful, and because\nof this, they are the welcome that you <em>offer</em> knowledge. Love waits on\nwelcome, <em>not</em> on time, and the real world is but your welcome of what\nalways was. Therefore, the call of joy is in it, and your glad response\nis your awakening to what you have not lost. Praise, then, the Father\nfor the perfect sanity of His most holy Son.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> Your Father knoweth that you have need of nothing. In Heaven this is\nso, for what could you need in eternity? In <em>your</em> world you <em>do</em> need\nthings because it is a world of scarcity in which you find yourself\n<em>because</em> you are lacking. Yet <em>can</em> you find yourself in such a world?\nWithout the Holy Spirit, the answer would be no. Yet because of Him, the\nanswer is a joyous <em>yes</em>! As Mediator between the two worlds, He knows\nwhat you have need of and what will not hurt you. Ownership is a\ndangerous concept if it is left to you. The ego wants to <em>have</em> things\nfor salvation, for possession is its law. Possession for its <em>own</em> sake\nis the ego’s fundamental creed, a basic cornerstone in the churches that\nit builds unto itself. And at <em>its</em> altar it demands you lay <em>all</em> of\nthe things it bids you get, leaving you no joy in them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> Everything that the ego tells you that you need will hurt you. For\nalthough the ego urges you again and again to <em>get</em>, it leaves you\nnothing, for what you get, it will <em>demand</em> of you. And even from the\nvery hands that grasped it, it will be wrenched and hurled into the\ndust. For where the ego sees salvation, it sees <em>separation</em>, and so you\nlose whatever you have gotten in its name. Therefore ask not of\nyourselves what you need, for <em>you do not know</em> and your advice unto\nyourself <em>will</em> hurt you. For what you think you need will merely serve\nto tighten up your world <em>against</em> the light and render you unwilling to\nquestion the value that this world can really hold for you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> Only the Holy Spirit <em>knows</em> what you need. For He will give you all\nthings that do not block the way to light. And what else <em>could</em> you\nneed? In time He gives you all the things that you need have and will\nrenew them as long as you have need of them. He will take nothing from\nyou as long as you have <em>any</em> need of it. And yet He knows that\neverything you need is temporary and will but last until you step aside\nfrom <em>all</em> your needs and learn that all of them <em>have been</em> fulfilled.\nTherefore He has no investment in the things that He supplies except to\nmake certain that you will not use them on behalf of lingering in time.\nHe knows that you are not at home there, and He wills no delay to wait\nupon your joyous homecoming.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> Leave, then, your needs to Him. He will supply them with no emphasis\nat all upon them. What comes to you of Him comes safely, for He will\nensure it never can become a dark spot, hidden in your mind and kept to\nhurt you. Under His guidance, you will travel light and journey lightly,\nfor His sight is ever on the journey’s end which is His goal. God’s Son\nis not a traveler through <em>outer</em> worlds. However holy his perception\nmay become, no world outside himself holds his inheritance. Within\nhimself he <em>has</em> no needs, for light needs nothing but to shine in peace\nand from itself to let the rays extend in quiet to infinity.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> Whenever you are tempted to undertake a foolish journey that would\nlead <em>away</em> from light, remember what you really want and say,</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> <em>The Holy Spirit leads me unto Christ,<br />\nand where else would I go?<br />\nWhat need have I but to awake in Him?</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> Then follow Him in joy, with faith that He will lead you\nsafely through all dangers to your peace of mind that this world sets\nbefore you. Kneel not before the altars to sacrifice and seek not what\nyou will surely lose. Content yourselves with what you will as surely\n<em>keep</em> and be not restless, for you undertake a quiet journey to the\npeace of God, where He would have you be in quietness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> In me you have already overcome <em>every</em> temptation that would hold\nyou back. We walk together on the way to quietness that is the gift of\nGod. Hold me dear, for what except your brothers <em>can</em> you need? We will\nrestore to you the peace of mind that we must find <em>together.</em> The Holy\nSpirit will teach you to awaken unto us and to yourself. This is the\nonly <em>real</em> need to be fulfilled in time. Salvation <em>from</em> the world\nlies only here. My peace I <em>give</em> you. <em>Take</em> it of me in glad exchange\nfor all the world has offered but to take away. And we will spread it\nlike a veil of light across the world’s sad face, in which we hide our\nbrothers <em>from</em> the world, and it from them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> We cannot sing redemption’s hymn alone. My task is not completed\nuntil I have lifted every voice with mine. And yet it is <em>not</em> mine, for\nas it is my gift to you, so was it the Father’s gift to me, given me\nthrough His Spirit. The sound of it will banish sorrow from the Mind of\nGod’s most holy Son, where it cannot abide. Healing in time <em>is</em> needed,\nfor joy cannot establish its eternal reign where sorrow dwells. You\ndwell not here, but in eternity. You travel but in dreams while safe at\nhome. Give thanks to every part of you that you have taught how to\n<em>remember</em> you. Thus does the Son of God give thanks unto his Father for\nhis purity.</p>\n\n",

He teaches that the past does not exist, a fact which\nbelongs to the sphere of knowledge and which therefore no one in the\nworld knows.

Yet the last step must be taken by God\nbecause the last step in your redemption, which seems to be in the\nfuture, was accomplished by God in your creation. The separation has not\ninterrupted it. Creation cannot <em>be</em> interrupted. The separation is\nmerely a faulty formulation of reality with no effect at all. The\nmiracle, without a function in Heaven, <em>is</em> needful here. Aspects of\nreality can still be seen, and they will replace aspects of <em>un</em>reality.\nAspects of reality can be seen in everything and everywhere. Yet only\nGod can gather them together by crowning them as one with the final gift\nof eternity.</p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup> Apart from the Father and the Son, the Holy Spirit has no function. He\nis not separate from either, being in the mind of both and knowing that\nmind is one. He is a Thought of God, and God has given Him to you\nbecause He has no Thoughts He does not share. His message speaks of\ntimelessness in time, and that is why Christ’s vision looks on\neverything with love. Yet even Christ’s vision is not His reality. The\ngolden aspects of reality which spring to light under His loving gaze\nare partial glimpses of the Heaven that lies <em>beyond</em> them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> This is the miracle of creation; <em>that</em> <em>it is one forever</em>. Every\nmiracle you offer to the Son of God is but the true perception of one\naspect of the whole. Though every aspect <em>is</em> the whole, you cannot know\nthis until you see that every aspect is the <em>same</em>, perceived in the\nsame <em>light</em> and <em>therefore</em> one. Everyone seen <em>without</em> the past thus\nbrings you nearer to the end of time by bringing healed and healing\nsight into the darkness and enabling the world to see. For light must\ncome into the darkened world to make Christ’s vision possible even here.\nHelp Him to give His gift of light to all who think they wander in the\ndarkness, and let Him gather them into His quiet sight that makes them\none.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> They are all the same; all beautiful and equal in their holiness. And\nHe will offer them unto His Father as they were offered unto Him. There\nis <em>one</em> miracle, as there is <em>one</em> reality. And every miracle you do\ncontains them all, as every aspect of reality you see blends quietly\ninto the One Reality of God. The only miracle that ever was is God’s\nmost holy Son, created in the One Reality that is his Father. Christ’s\nvision is His gift to you. His Being is His Father’s gift to Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> Be you content with healing, for Christ’s gift you <em>can</em> bestow, and\nyour Father’s gift you <em>cannot</em> lose. Offer Christ’s gift to everyone\nand everywhere, for miracles offered the Son of God through the Holy\nSpirit attune you to reality. The Holy Spirit knows your part in the\nredemption and who are seeking you and where to find them. Knowledge is\nfar beyond your individual concern. You, who are part of it and all of\nit, need only realize that it is of the Father, <em>not</em> of you. Your role\nin the redemption leads you to it by reestablishing its oneness in your\nminds.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> When you have seen your brothers as yourself, you will be <em>released</em>\nto knowledge, having learned to free yourself of Him Who knows of\nfreedom. Unite with me under the holy banner of His teaching, and as we\ngrow in strength, the power of God’s Son will move in us, and we will\nleave no one untouched and no one left alone. And suddenly time will be\nover, and we will all unite in the eternity of God the Father. The holy\nlight you saw outside yourself in every miracle you offered to your\nbrothers will be <em>returned</em> to you. And <em>knowing</em> that the light is <em>in</em>\nyou, your creations will be there with you, as you are in your Father.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> As miracles in this world join you to your brothers, so do your\ncreations establish your fatherhood in Heaven. <em>You</em> are the witnesses\nto the Fatherhood of God, and He has given you the power to create the\nwitnesses to [<em>yours</em>, which is as <em>His.</em> Deny a brother here, and you\ndeny the witnesses to] your fatherhood in Heaven.

The miracles you do on earth are\nlifted up to Heaven and to Him. They witness to what you do not know,\nand as they reach the gates of Heaven, God will open them. For never\nwould He leave His own beloved Son outside them and beyond Himself.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>11</sup> Guilt remains the only thing that hides the Father, for guilt is the\nattack upon His Son. The guilty <em>always</em> condemn, and having done so,\nthey <em>will</em> condemn, linking the future to the past as is the ego’s law.\nFidelity unto this law lets no light in, for it <em>demands</em> fidelity to\ndarkness and <em>forbids</em> awakening. The ego’s laws are strict, and\nbreaches are severely punished. Therefore give no obedience to its laws,\nfor they are laws of punishment. And those who follow them believe that\nthey are guilty, and so they <em>must</em> condemn. Between the future and the\npast, the laws of God must intervene if you would free yourselves.\nAtonement stands between them like a lamp that shines so brightly that\nthe chain of darkness in which you bound yourselves will disappear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> Release from guilt is the ego’s whole undoing. <em>Make no one fearful</em>,\nfor his guilt is yours, and by obeying the ego’s harsh commandments, you\nbring its condemnation of yourself, and you will not escape the\npunishment it offers those who obey it. The ego rewards fidelity to it\nwith pain, for faith in it <em>is</em> pain. And faith can be rewarded only in\nterms of the belief in which the faith was placed. Faith <em>makes</em> the\npower of belief, and where it is invested determines its reward. For\nfaith is <em>always</em> given what is treasured, and what is treasured <em>is</em>\nreturned to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> The world can give you only what you gave it, for being nothing but\nyour own projection, it <em>has</em> no meaning apart from what you found in it\nand placed your faith in. Be faithful unto darkness and you will <em>not</em>\nsee, because your faith will be rewarded as you <em>gave</em> it. You will\naccept your treasure, and if you place your faith in the past, the\nfuture <em>will</em> be like it. Whatever you hold as dear, you think is\n<em>yours.</em> The power of your <em>valuing</em> will make it so.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> Atonement brings a re-evaluation of everything you cherish, for it is\nthe means by which the Holy Spirit can separate the false and the true,\nwhich you have accepted into your minds <em>without distinction.</em>\nTherefore, <em>you</em> cannot value one without the other, and guilt has\nbecome as true <em>for you</em> as innocence. You do not believe the Son of God\nis guiltless because you see the past and see <em>him</em> not. When you\ncondemn a brother, you are saying, “I who was guilty choose to <em>remain</em>\nso.” You have denied <em>his</em> freedom, and by so doing you have denied the\nwitness unto <em>yours.</em> You could as easily have <em>freed</em> him from the past\nand lifted from his mind the cloud of guilt that binds him to it. And in\n<em>his</em> freedom would have been your <em>own.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> Lay not his guilt upon him, for his guilt lies in his secret that he\nthinks that he has done this unto <em>you</em>. Would you, then, teach him that\nhe is <em>right</em> in his delusion? The idea that the guiltless Son of God\ncan attack himself and <em>make</em> himself guilty is insane. In <em>any</em> form,\nin <em>anyone</em>, <em>believe this not</em>. For sin and condemnation are the same,\nand the belief in one is faith in the other, calling for punishment\n<em>instead</em> of love. <em>Nothing</em> can justify insanity, and to call for\npunishment upon yourself <em>must</em> be insane.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> See no one, then, as guilty, and you will affirm the truth of\nguiltlessness unto <em>yourself</em>. In every condemnation that you offer the\nSon of God lies the conviction of your <em>own</em> guilt. If you would have\nthe Holy Spirit make you free of it, accept His offer of Atonement for\nall your brothers. For so you learn that it is true for <em>you</em>. Remember\nalways that it is impossible to condemn the Son of God <em>in part</em>. Those\nwhom you see as guilty become the witnesses to guilt in <em>you</em>, and you\nwill <em>see</em> it there, for it <em>is</em> there until it is undone. Guilt is\n<em>always</em> in your own mind, which has condemned <em>itself</em>. Project it not,\nfor while you do, it cannot <em>be</em> undone. With everyone whom you release\nfrom guilt, great is the joy in Heaven, where the witnesses to your\nfatherhood rejoice.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> Guilt makes you blind, for while you see one spot of guilt within\nyou, you will <em>not</em> see the light. And by projecting it, the <em>world</em>\nseems dark and shrouded in your guilt. You throw a dark veil over it and\ncannot see it <em>because you cannot look within.</em> You are afraid of what\nyou would see there, but it is <em>not</em> there. <em>The thing you fear is\ngone</em>. If you would look within, you would see only the Atonement,\nshining in quiet and in peace upon the altar to your Father.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> Do not be afraid to look within. The ego tells you all is black with\nguilt within you and bids you <em>not</em> to look. Instead, it bids you look\nupon your brothers <em>and see the guilt in them.</em> Yet this you cannot do\nwithout remaining blind. For those who see their brothers in the dark,\nand guilty in the dark in which they shroud them, are too afraid to look\nupon the light within. Within you is not what <em>you</em> believe is there and\nwhat you put your faith in.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> Within you is the holy sign of perfect faith your Father has in you.\nHe does not value you as you do. He knows Himself and knows the truth in\n<em>you.</em> He knows <em>there is no difference</em>, for He knows not of\ndifferences. Can <em>you</em> see guilt where God <em>knows</em> there is perfect\ninnocence? You can <em>deny</em> His knowledge, but you cannot <em>change</em> it.\nLook, then, upon the light He placed within you and learn that what you\nfeared was there <em>has been</em> replaced with love.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>20</sup> You are accustomed to the notion that the mind can see the source of\npain where it is not. The doubtful service of displacement is to hide\nthe <em>real</em> source of your guilt and <em>keep</em> from your awareness the full\nperception <em>that it is insane</em>. Displacement always is maintained by the\nillusion that the source, from which attention is diverted, must be\n<em>true and must be fearful</em>, or you would not have displaced the guilt\nonto what you believed to be <em>less</em> fearful. You are therefore willing\nwith little opposition to look upon all sorts of “sources” underneath\nawareness, provided that they are not the deeper source to which they\nbear no real relationship at all.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> Insane ideas <em>have</em> no real relationships, for that is <em>why</em> they are\ninsane. No real relationship can rest on guilt or even hold one spot of\nit to mar its purity. For all relationships which guilt has touched are\nused but to avoid the person <em>and</em> the guilt. What strange relationships\nyou have made for this strange purpose! And you forgot that real\nrelationships are holy and cannot be used by <em>you</em> at all. They are used\nonly by the Holy Spirit, and it is that which <em>makes</em> them pure. [If\nyou displace <em>your</em> guilt upon them, the Holy Spirit cannot use them.]\nFor by preempting for your <em>own</em> ends what you should have given to Him,\nHe cannot use them unto <em>your</em> release. No one who would unite in <em>any</em>\nway with <em>anyone</em> for his <em>own</em> salvation will find it in that strange\nrelationship. It is not shared, and so it is not real.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> In any union with a brother in which you seek to lay your guilt upon\nhim or share it with him or perceive his own, you <em>will</em> feel guilty.\nNor will you find satisfaction and peace with him, because your union\nwith him is <em>not</em> real. You will see guilt in that relationship because\nyou <em>put</em> it there. It is inevitable that those who suffer guilt <em>will</em>\nattempt to displace it, because they <em>do</em> believe in it. Yet, though\nthey suffer, they will not look within and let it <em>go</em>. They cannot know\nthey love and cannot understand what loving <em>is</em>. Their main concern is\nto perceive the source of guilt outside themselves, <em>beyond</em> their own\ncontrol.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> When you maintain that you are guilty but the source lies in the\n<em>past</em>, you are <em>not</em> looking inward. The past is not <em>in</em> you. Your\nweird associations to it have no meaning in the present. Yet you let\nthem stand between you and your brothers, with whom you find no <em>real</em>\nrelationships at all. Can you expect to use your brothers as a means to\n“solve” the past and still to see them as they really are? Salvation is\nnot found by those who use their brothers to resolve problems which are\nnot there. You wanted not salvation in the past. Would you impose your\nidle wishes on the present and hope to find salvation <em>now</em>?</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> Determine, then, to be not as you were. Use no relationship to hold\nyou to the past, but with each one each day be born again. A minute,\neven less, will be enough to free you from the past and give your mind\nin peace over to the Atonement. When everyone is welcome to you as you\nwould have yourself be welcome to your Father, you will see no guilt in\nyou. For you will have accepted the Atonement, which shone within you\nall the while you dreamed of guilt and would not look within and see it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> As long as you believe that guilt is justified in <em>any</em> way in\n<em>anyone whatever</em> he may do, you will not look within, where you would\n<em>always</em> find Atonement. The end of guilt will never come as long as you\nbelieve there is a <em>reason</em> for it. For you must learn that guilt is\n<em>always</em> totally insane and <em>has</em> no reason. The Holy Spirit seeks not\nto dispel reality. If <em>guilt</em> were real, <em>Atonement</em> would not be. The\npurpose of Atonement is to dispel illusions, not to establish them as\nreal and <em>then</em> forgive them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> The Holy Spirit does not keep illusions in your mind to frighten you\nand show them to you fearfully to demonstrate what He has saved you\n<em>from</em>. What He has saved you from is <em>gone</em>. Give no reality to guilt,\nand see <em>no</em> reason for it. The Holy Spirit does what God would have Him\ndo and has always done so. He has seen separation, but knows of union.\nHe teaches healing, but He also knows of creation. He would have you see\nand teach as He does, and through Him. Yet what He knows, you do not\nknow, though it is yours.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> <em>Now</em> it is given you to heal and teach, to make what will be <em>now</em>.\nAs yet it is <em>not</em> now. The Son of God believes that he is lost in\nguilt, alone in a dark world where pain is pressing everywhere upon him\nfrom <em>without</em>. When he has looked within and seen the radiance there,\nhe will remember how much his Father loves him. And it will seem\nincredible that he has ever thought his Father loved him not and looked\nupon him as condemned. The moment that you realize guilt is <em>insane,\nwholly</em> unjustified, and <em>wholly</em> without reason, you will not fear to\nlook upon the Atonement and accept it wholly.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> You who have been unmerciful unto yourselves do not remember your\nFather’s Love. And looking without mercy upon your brothers, you do not\nremember how much you love <em>Him</em>. Yet it is forever true. In shining\npeace within you is the perfect purity in which you were created. Fear\nnot to look upon the lovely truth in you. Look <em>through</em> the cloud of\nguilt that dims your vision, and look <em>past</em> darkness to the holy place\nwhere you will see the light. The altar to your Father is as pure as He\nWho raised it to Himself. Nothing can keep from you what Christ would\nhave you see. His Will is like His Father’s, and He offers mercy to\nevery Child of God, as He would have <em>you</em> do.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> <em>Release</em> from guilt as you would <em>be</em> released. There is no other\nway to look within and see the light of love shining as steadily and as\nsurely as God Himself has always loved His Son. <em>And as His son loves\nHim</em>. There is no fear in love, for love is guiltless. You who have\nalways loved your Father can have no fear for <em>any</em> reason to look\nwithin and see your holiness. You cannot <em>be</em> as you believed you were.\nYour guilt is without reason, because it is not in the Mind of God where\n<em>you</em> are. And this <em>is</em> reason, which the Holy Spirit would <em>restore</em>\nto you. He would remove only illusions. All else He would have you see.\nAnd in Christ’s vision, He would show you the perfect purity that is\nforever within God’s Son.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> You cannot enter into <em>real</em> relationships with any of God’s Sons\nunless you love them all and <em>equally</em>. Love is not special. If you\nsingle out <em>part</em> of the Sonship for your love, you are imposing guilt\non <em>all</em> your relationships and making them unreal. You can love <em>only</em>\nas God loves. Seek not to love unlike Him, for there <em>is</em> no love apart\nfrom His. Until you recognize that this is true, you will have no idea\nwhat love is like. No one who condemns a brother can see himself as\nguiltless in the peace of God. If he <em>is</em> guiltless and in peace and\nsees it not, he <em>is</em> delusional and has not looked upon himself. To him\nI say,</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> <em>Behold the Son of God and look upon his purity and<br />\nbe still. In quiet look upon his holiness and offer thanks<br />\nunto his Father that no guilt has ever touched him.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> No illusion that you have ever held against him has touched his\ninnocence in any way. His shining purity, wholly untouched by guilt and\nwholly loving, is bright within you. Let us look upon him together and\nlove him. For in our love of him is your guiltlessness. But look upon\nyourself, and gladness and appreciation for what you see will banish\nguilt forever. I thank You, Father, for the purity of Your most holy\nSon, whom You have created guiltless forever.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> Like you my faith and my belief are centered on what I treasure. The\ndifference is that I love <em>only</em> what God loves with me, and because of\nthis, I treasure you beyond the value that you set on yourselves, even\nunto the worth that God has placed upon you. I love all that He created,\nand all my faith and my belief I offer unto it. My faith in you is\nstrong as all the love I give my Father. My trust in you is without\nlimit and without the fear that you will hear me not. I thank the Father\nfor your loveliness and for the many gifts that you will let me offer to\nthe Kingdom in honor of its wholeness, which is of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> Praise be unto you who make the Father one with His own Son. Alone we\nare all lowly, but together we shine with brightness so intense that\nnone of us alone can even think on it. Before the glorious radiance of\nthe Kingdom, guilt melts away and, transformed into kindness, will never\nmore be what it was. Every reaction that you experience will be so\npurified that it is fitting as a hymn of praise unto your Father. See\nonly praise of Him in what He has created, for He will never cease His\npraise of <em>you</em>. United in this praise, we stand before the gates of\nHeaven where we will surely enter in our blamelessness. God loves you.\nCould I, then, lack faith in you and love Him perfectly?</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> Forgetfulness and sleep and even death become the ego’s best advice\nfor how to deal with the perceived and harsh intrusion of guilt on\npeace. Yet no one sees himself in conflict and ravaged by a cruel war\nunless he believes that <em>both</em> opponents in the war are real. Believing\nthis, he must escape, for such a war would surely end his peace of mind\nand so destroy him. Yet if he could but realize the war is between\nforces that are real and <em>unreal</em> powers, he could look upon himself and\n<em>see</em> his freedom. No one finds himself ravaged and torn in endless\nbattles which he <em>himself</em> perceives as wholly without meaning.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> God would not have His Son embattled, and so His Son’s imagined\n“enemy,” which he made, is <em>totally</em> unreal. You are but trying to\nescape a bitter war from which you <em>have</em> escaped. The war is gone. For\nyou have heard the hymn of freedom rising unto Heaven. Gladness and joy\nbelong to God for your release, because you made it not. Yet as you made\nnot freedom, so you made not a war that could <em>endanger</em> freedom.\nNothing destructive ever was or will be. The war, the guilt, the past\nare gone as one into the unreality from which they came.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>37</sup> When we are all united in Heaven, you will value <em>nothing</em> that you\nvalue here. For nothing that you value here you value wholly, and so you\ndo not value it at all. Value is where God placed it, and the value of\nwhat God esteems cannot <em>be</em> judged, for it has been <em>established</em>. It\nis <em>wholly</em> of value. It can merely be appreciated or not. To value it\npartially is not to <em>know</em> its value. In Heaven is everything God valued\nand nothing else. Heaven is perfectly unambiguous. Everything is clear\nand bright and calls forth <em>one</em> response. There is no darkness, and\nthere is no contrast. There is no variation. There is no interruption.\nThere is a sense of peace so deep that no dream in this world has ever\nbrought even a dim imagining of what it is.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> Nothing in this world can give this peace, for nothing in this world\nis wholly shared. Perfect perception can merely show you what is\n<em>capable</em> of being wholly shared. It can also show you the <em>results</em> of\nsharing while you still remember the results of <em>not</em> sharing. The Holy\nSpirit points quietly to the contrast, knowing that you will finally let\nHim judge the difference for you, allowing Him to demonstrate which\n<em>must</em> be true. He has perfect faith in your final judgment because He\nknows that He will make it <em>for</em> you. To doubt this would be to doubt\nthat His mission will be fulfilled. How is this possible, when His\nmission is of God?</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> You whose minds are darkened by doubt and guilt, remember this: God\ngave the Holy Spirit to you and gave Him the mission to remove all doubt\nand every trace of guilt that His dear Son has laid upon himself. It is\n<em>impossible</em> that this mission fail. Nothing can prevent what God would\nhave accomplished from accomplishment. Whatever your reactions to the\nHoly Spirit’s Voice may be, whatever voice you choose to listen to,\nwhatever strange thoughts may occur to you, God’s Will <em>is</em> done. You\n<em>will</em> find the peace in which He has established you, because He does\nnot change His Mind. He is invariable as the peace in which you dwell\nand of which the Holy Spirit reminds you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> You will not remember change and shift in Heaven. You have need of\ncontrast only here. Contrast and differences are necessary teaching\naids, for by them you learn what to avoid and what to seek. When you\nhave learned this, you will find the answer that makes the need for\n<em>any</em> differences disappear. Truth comes of its own will unto its own.\nWhen you have learned that you <em>belong</em> to truth, it will flow lightly\nover you without a difference of any kind. For you will need no contrast\nto help you realize that this is what you want, and <em>only</em> this. Fear\nnot the Holy Spirit will fail in what your Father has given Him to do.\nThe Will of God can fail in <em>nothing</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> Have faith in only this one thing, and it will be sufficient: God\nwills you be in Heaven, and nothing can keep <em>you</em> from it or <em>it</em> from\nyou. Your wildest misperceptions, your weird imaginings, your blackest\nnightmares all mean nothing. They will not prevail against the peace God\nwills for you. The Holy Spirit will restore your sanity, because\ninsanity is <em>not</em> the Will of God. If that suffices Him, it is enough\nfor you. You will not keep what God would have removed, because it\nbreaks communication with you with whom He would communicate. His voice\n<em>will</em> be heard.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> The Communication Link which God Himself placed within you, joining\nyour minds with His, <em>cannot</em> be broken. You may believe you <em>want</em> it\nbroken, and this belief <em>does</em> interfere with the deep peace in which\nthe sweet and constant communication which God would share with you is\nknown. Yet His channels of reaching out cannot be wholly closed and\nseparated from Him. Peace will be yours, because His peace still flows\nto you from Him Whose Will <em>is</em> peace. You have it <em>now.</em> The Holy\nSpirit will teach you how to <em>use</em> it and, by projecting it, to learn\nthat it is in you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> God willed you Heaven and will <em>always</em> will you nothing else. The\nHoly Spirit knows <em>only</em> of His Will. There is no chance that Heaven\nwill not be yours, for God is sure, and what He wills is as sure as He\nis. You will learn salvation, because you will learn <em>how to save</em>. It\nwill not be possible to exempt yourself from what the Holy Spirit wills\nto teach you. Salvation is as sure as God. His certainty suffices. Learn\nthat even the darkest nightmare that disturbed the Mind of God’s\nsleeping Son holds no power over him. He <em>will</em> learn the lesson of\nawaking. God watches over him, and light surrounds him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> Can God’s Son lose himself in dreams when God has placed <em>within</em> him\nthe glad call to waken and be glad? He cannot separate <em>himself</em> from\nwhat is <em>in</em> him. His sleep will not withstand the call to wake. The\nmission of redemption will be fulfilled as surely as the creation will\nremain unchanged throughout eternity. You do not have to know that\nHeaven is yours to make it so. It <em>is</em> so. Yet the Will of God must be\naccepted as <em>your</em> will to know it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> The Holy Spirit cannot fail to undo <em>for</em> you everything you have\nlearned that teaches you what is not true must be reconciled with truth.\nThis is the reconciliation which the ego would substitute for your\nreconciliation unto sanity and unto peace. The Holy Spirit has a very\ndifferent kind of reconciliation in His Mind for you, and one which He\n<em>will</em> effect as surely as the ego will <em>not</em> effect what it attempts.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> Failure is of the ego, <em>not</em> of God. From Him you <em>cannot</em> wander,\nand there is no possibility that the plan the Holy Spirit offers to\neveryone for the salvation <em>of</em> everyone will not be perfectly\naccomplished. You <em>will</em> be released, and you will not remember anything\nyou made that was not created <em>for</em> you and <em>by</em> you in return. For how\ncan you remember what was <em>never</em> true or <em>not</em> remember what has always\nbeen? It is this reconciliation with truth, and <em>only</em> truth, in which\nthe peace of Heaven lies.</p>\n\n",

The\nHoly Spirit uses logic as easily and as well as does the ego, except\nthat His conclusions are <em>not</em> insane. They take a direction exactly\nopposite, pointing as clearly to Heaven as the ego points to darkness\nand to death. We have followed much of the ego’s logic and have seen its\nlogical conclusions. And having seen them, we have realized that they\ncannot be seen but in illusions, for there alone their seeming clearness\n<em>seems</em> to be clearly seen. Let us now turn away from them and follow\nthe simple logic by which the Holy Spirit teaches you the simple\nconclusions that speak for truth and <em>only</em> truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> If you are blessed and do not know it, you need to <em>learn</em> it must be\nso.

If what you offer <em>is</em> complete forgiveness, you <em>must</em> have\nlet guilt go, accepting the Atonement for yourself and learning you are\nguiltless. How could you learn what has been done for you, but which you\ndo not know, unless you do what you would <em>have</em> to do if it <em>had</em> been\ndone unto you? <em>In</em>direct proof of truth is needed in a world made of\ndenial and without direction. You will perceive the need for this if you\nwill realize that to deny is the decision <em>not</em> to know.

That is why God placed the Holy Spirit <em>in</em> you,\nwhere you placed the dream.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> Seeing is always <em>outward</em>. Were your thoughts wholly of <em>you</em>, the\nthought system which you made would be forever dark. The thoughts which\nthe Mind of God’s Son projects have all the power that he gives to them.\nThe thoughts he shares with God are <em>beyond</em> his belief, but those he\nmade <em>are</em> his beliefs. And it is <em>these</em>, and <em>not</em> the truth, that he\nhas chosen to defend and love. They will not be taken from him. But they\ncan be <em>given up</em> by him, for the Source of their undoing is <em>in</em> him.\nThere is nothing <em>in</em> the world to teach him that the logic of the world\nis totally insane and leads to nothing.

These are but indirect expressions of the will\nto live, which has been blocked by the capricious and unholy whim of\ndeath and murder that your Father shared not with you.

    "content": "<p><sup>54</sup> The Holy Spirit needs a happy learner in whom His mission can be\nhappily accomplished. You who are steadfastly devoted to misery must\nfirst recognize that you <em>are</em> miserable and <em>not</em> happy. The Holy\nSpirit cannot teach without this contrast, for you believe that misery\n<em>is</em> happiness. This has so confused you that you have undertaken to\nlearn to do what you can <em>never</em> do, believing that <em>unless</em> you learn\nit, you will not be happy. You do not realize that the foundation on\nwhich this most peculiar learning goal depends means <em>absolutely\nnothing</em>. It <em>does</em> make sense to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> Have faith in nothing, and you will <em>find</em> the “treasure” that you\nsought. Yet you will add another burden to your mind, <em>already</em> burdened\nor you would not have sought another. You will believe that nothing is\n<em>of value</em> and <em>will</em> value it. A little piece of glass, a speck of\ndust, a body or a war are one to you. For if you value <em>one</em> thing made\nof nothing, you <em>have</em> believed that nothing can be precious and that\nyou <em>can</em> learn how to make the untrue <em>true</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> The Holy Spirit, <em>seeing</em> where you are but <em>knowing</em> you are\nelsewhere, begins His lesson in simplicity with the fundamental teaching\nthat <em>truth is true</em>. This is the hardest lesson you will ever learn,\nand in the end the <em>only</em> one. Simplicity is very difficult for twisted\nminds. Consider all the distortions you have made of nothing—all the\nstrange forms and feelings and actions and reactions that you have woven\nout of it. Nothing is so alien to you as the simple truth, and nothing\nare you less inclined to listen to. The contrast between what is true\nand what is not is <em>perfectly</em> apparent, yet you do not see it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> The simple and the obvious are not apparent to those who would make\npalaces and royal robes of nothing, believing they are kings with golden\ncrowns because of them. All this the Holy Spirit sees and teaches simply\nthat all this is not true. To these unhappy learners who would teach\nthemselves nothing and delude themselves into believing that it is <em>not</em>\nnothing, the Holy Spirit says, with steadfast quietness:</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> <em>The truth is true. Nothing else matters, nothing else is real, and\neverything beside it is not there. Let Me make the one distinction for\nyou which you cannot make but need to <strong>learn</strong>. Your faith in\nnothing <strong>is</strong> deceiving you. Offer your faith to Me, and I will\nplace it gently in the holy place where it belongs. You will find\n<strong>no</strong> deception there but only the simple truth. And you will love\nit because you will <strong>understand</strong> it.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> Like you, the Holy Spirit did not <em>make</em> truth. Like God, He <em>knows</em>\nit to be true. He brings the light of truth into the darkness and <em>lets</em>\nit shine on you. And as it shines, your brothers see it, and realizing\nthat this light is not what you have made, they see in you more than\n<em>you</em> see. They will be happy learners of the lesson which this light\nbrings to them because it teaches them <em>release</em> from nothing and from\nall the works of nothing.  The heavy chains which seem to bind them unto\ndespair they do not see as nothing until you bring the light to them.\nAnd <em>then</em> they see the chains have disappeared, and so they <em>must</em> have\nbeen nothing. And <em>you</em> will see it with them. <em>Because</em> you taught them\ngladness and release, they will become <em>your</em> teachers in release and\ngladness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> When you teach anyone that truth is true, you learn it <em>with</em> him.\nAnd so you learn that what seemed hardest was the easiest. Learn to be\nhappy learners. You will <em>never</em> learn how to make nothing everything.\nYet see that this <em>has</em> been your goal and <em>recognize</em> how foolish it\nhas been. Be glad it is undone, for when you look at it in simple\nhonesty, it <em>is</em> undone. We said before, “Be not content with nothing,”\nfor you <em>have</em> believed that nothing could content you. <em>It is not so</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> If you would be a happy learner, you must give <em>everything</em> that you\nhave learned over to the Holy Spirit to be <em>unlearned</em> for you. And then\nbegin to learn the joyous lessons that come quickly on the firm\nfoundation that truth is true. For what is builded there <em>is</em> true and\n<em>built</em> on truth. The universe of learning will open up before you in\nall its gracious simplicity. With truth before you, you will not look\nback.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> The happy learner meets the conditions of learning here, as he also\nmeets the conditions of knowledge in the Kingdom. All this lies in the\nHoly Spirit’s plan to free you from the past and open up the way to\nfreedom for you. For truth <em>is</em> true. What else could ever be or ever\nwas? This simple lesson holds the key to the dark door which you believe\nis locked forever. You <em>made</em> this door of nothing and behind it <em>is</em>\nnothing. The key is only the light which shines away the shapes and\nforms and fears of nothing. Accept this key to freedom from the hands of\nChrist Who gives it to you that you may join Him in the holy task of\nbringing light to darkness. For, like your brothers, you do not realize\nthe light has come and <em>freed</em> you from the sleep of darkness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> Behold your brothers in their freedom and learn of them how to be\n<em>free</em> of darkness. The light in you will waken them, and they will not\nleave <em>you</em> asleep. The vision of Christ is given the very instant that\nit is perceived. Where everything is clear, it is all holy. The\nquietness of its simplicity is so compelling that you will realize it is\n<em>impossible</em> to deny the simple truth. For there <em>is</em> nothing else. God\nis everywhere, and His Son is in Him with everything. Can he sing the\ndirge of sorrow when <em>this</em> is true?</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>64</sup> Learning will be commensurate with motivation, and the interference\nin your motivation for learning is exactly the same as that which\ninterferes with <em>all</em> your thinking. The happy learner cannot <em>feel</em>\n<em>guilty</em> about learning. This is so essential to learning that it should\nnever be forgotten. The guiltless learner learns so easily because his\nthoughts are free. Yet this entails the recognition that guilt is\n<em>interference, not</em> salvation, and serves no useful function at all.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> You are accustomed to using guiltlessness merely to offset the pain\nof guilt and do not look upon it as having value <em>in itself</em>. You\nbelieve that guilt and guiltlessness are <em>both</em> of value, each\nrepresenting an escape from what the other does not offer you. You do\nnot want either alone, for without both, you do not see yourselves as\nwhole and therefore happy. Yet you are whole <em>only</em> in your\nguiltlessness, and only in your guiltlessness <em>can</em> you be happy. There\n<em>is</em> no conflict here. To wish for guilt in <em>any</em> way, in <em>any</em> form,\nwill lose appreciation of the value of your guiltlessness and push it\nfrom your sight.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> There is no compromise that you can make with guilt and escape the\npain which <em>only</em> guiltlessness allays. Learning is living here, as\ncreating is being in Heaven. Whenever the pain of guilt <em>seems</em> to\nattract you, remember that, if you yield to it, you are deciding\n<em>against</em> your happiness and will not learn <em>how</em> to be happy. Say\ntherefore to yourself gently, but with the conviction born of the love\nof God and of His Son,</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> <em>What I experience, I will make manifest.<br />\nIf I am guiltless, I have nothing to fear.<br />\nI choose to testify to my <strong>acceptance</strong> of\nthe Atonement, <strong>not</strong> for its rejection.<br />\nI would accept my guiltlessness by making it manifest and <strong>sharing</strong> it.<br />\nLet me bring peace to God’s Son from his Father.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> Each day, each hour and minute, even every second, you are deciding\nbetween the crucifixion and the resurrection, between the ego and the\nHoly Spirit. The ego is the choice for guilt; the Holy Spirit the\ndecision for guiltlessness. The power of decision is all that is yours.\nWhat you can decide <em>between</em> is fixed because there are no alternatives\nexcept truth and illusion. And there is no overlap between them because\nthey are opposites which <em>cannot</em> be reconciled and <em>cannot</em> both be\ntrue. You are guilty <em>or</em> guiltless, bound <em>or</em> free, happy <em>or</em>\nunhappy.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> The miracle teaches you that you have chosen guiltlessness, freedom,\nand joy. It is not a cause, but an <em>effect</em>. It is the natural result of\nchoosing right, attesting to your happiness that comes from choosing to\nbe free of guilt. Everyone you offer healing to returns it. Everyone you\nattack keeps it and cherishes it by holding it against you. Whether he\ndoes this or does it not will make no difference; you will <em>think</em> he\ndoes. It is impossible to offer what you do not want without this\npenalty. The cost of giving <em>is</em> receiving. Either it is a penalty from\nwhich you suffer or the happy purchase of a treasure to hold dear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> No penalty is ever asked of God’s Son except <em>by</em> himself and <em>of</em>\nhimself. Every chance given him to heal is another opportunity to\nreplace darkness with light and fear with love. If he refuses it, he\nbinds himself to darkness because he did not choose to free his brother\nand enter light with him. By <em>giving</em> power to nothing, he threw away\nthe joyous opportunity to learn that nothing <em>has</em> no power. And by\n<em>not</em> dispelling darkness, he became afraid of darkness <em>and</em> of light.\nThe joy of learning that darkness has no power over the Son of God is\nthe happy lesson the Holy Spirit teaches and would have <em>you</em> teach with\nHim. It is <em>His</em> joy to teach it, as it will be <em>yours.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> The way to teach this simple lesson is merely this: guiltlessness\n<em>is</em> invulnerability. Therefore, make your invulnerability manifest to\neveryone, and teach him that <em>whatever</em> he may try to do to you, your\nperfect freedom from the belief that you can be harmed shows him <em>he</em> is\nguiltless. He can do <em>nothing</em> that can hurt you, and by refusing to\nallow him to <em>think</em> he can, you teach him that the Atonement, which you\nhave accepted for <em>yourself</em>, is also <em>his.</em> There <em>is</em> nothing to\nforgive. No one can hurt the Son of God. His guilt is wholly without\ncause, and being without cause, <em>cannot</em> exist.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> God is the <em>only</em> Cause, and guilt is not of Him. Teach no one he has\nhurt you, for if you do, you teach yourself that what is not of God\n<em>has</em> power over you. <em>The causeless cannot be</em>. Do not attest to it,\nand do not foster belief in it in any mind. Remember always that <em>mind</em>\nis one and <em>cause</em> is one. You will learn communication with this\noneness <em>only</em> when you learn to <em>deny</em> the causeless and accept the\nCause of God as <em>yours</em>. The power that God has given to His Son <em>is</em>\nhis, and nothing else can His Son see or choose to look upon without\nimposing on himself the penalty of guilt <em>in place</em> of all the happy\nteaching the Holy Spirit would gladly offer him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> Whenever you decide to make decisions for yourself, you are thinking\ndestructively, and the decision <em>will</em> be wrong. It will hurt you\nbecause of the concept of decision which led to it. It is not true that\nyou can make decisions <em>by</em> yourself or <em>for</em> yourself alone. No thought\nof God’s Son <em>can</em> be separate or isolated in its effects. Every\ndecision is made for the <em>whole</em> Sonship, directed in and out and\ninfluencing a constellation larger than anything you ever dreamed of.\nThose who accept the Atonement <em>are</em> invulnerable. But those who believe\nthey are guilty <em>will</em> respond to guilt because they think it is\nsalvation and will not refuse to see it and side with it. [They\n<em>believe</em> that <em>increasing</em> guilt is self-<em>protection</em>.] And they will\nfail to understand the simple fact that what they do not want <em>must</em>\nhurt them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> All this arises because they do not believe that what they want is\n<em>good</em>. Yet will was given them <em>because</em> it is holy and will bring to\nthem <em>all</em> that they need, coming as naturally as peace that knows no\nlimits. There is nothing their wills will not provide that offers them\n<em>anything</em> of value. Yet because they do not understand their will, the\nHoly Spirit quietly understands it <em>for</em> them and <em>gives</em> them what they\nwill without effort, strain, or the impossible burden of deciding what\nthey want and need alone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> It will never happen that you will have to make decisions for\nyourself. You are not bereft of help, and Help that <em>knows</em> the answer.\nWould you be content with little, which is all that you alone can offer\nyourself, when He Who gives you everything will simply <em>offer</em> it to\nyou? He will never ask what you have done to make you worthy of the gift\nof God. Ask it not therefore of yourselves. Instead, accept His answer,\nfor He <em>knows</em> that you are worthy of everything God wills for you. Do\nnot try to escape the gift of God which He so freely and so gladly\noffers you. He offers you but what God gave Him <em>for</em> you. You need not\ndecide whether or not you are deserving of it. God knows you <em>are.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> Would you deny the truth of God’s decision and place your pitiful\nappraisal of yourself in place of His calm and unswerving value of His\nSon? <em>Nothing</em> can shake God’s conviction of the perfect purity of\neverything that He created, for it <em>is</em> wholly pure. Do not decide\nagainst it, for being of Him, it <em>must</em> be true. Peace abides in every\nmind that quietly accepts the plan which God has set for his Atonement,\nrelinquishing his <em>own</em>. You know not of salvation, for you do not\nunderstand it. Make no decisions about what it is or where it lies, but\nask of the Holy Spirit everything and leave <em>all</em> decisions to His\ngentle counsel.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> The One Who knows the plan of God which God would have you follow can\nteach you what it <em>is</em>. Only <em>His</em> wisdom is capable of guiding you to\nfollow it. Every decision you undertake alone but signifies that you\nwould define what salvation <em>is</em> and what you would be saved <em>from</em>. The\nHoly Spirit knows that <em>all</em> salvation is escape from guilt. You have no\nother “enemy,” and against this strange distortion of the purity of the\nSon of God, the Holy Spirit is your <em>only</em> friend. He is the strong\nprotector of your innocence, which sets you free. And it is <em>His</em>\ndecision to undo everything that would obscure your innocence from your\nunclouded mind.</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> Let Him, therefore, be the <em>only</em> Guide that you would follow to\nsalvation. He knows the way and leads you gladly on it. <em>With</em> Him you\nwill not fail to learn what God wills for you <em>is</em> your will. <em>Without</em>\nHis guidance, you will think you know alone and will decide <em>against</em>\nyour peace as surely as you made the wrong decision in ever thinking\nthat salvation lay in you alone. Salvation is of Him to Whom God gave it\nfor you. He has not forgotten it. Forget Him not, and He will make every\ndecision for you, for your salvation, and the peace of God in you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> Seek not to appraise the worth of God’s Son, whom He created holy,\nfor to do so is to evaluate his Father and judge <em>against</em> Him. And you\n<em>will</em> feel guilty for this imagined crime, which no one in this world\nor Heaven could possibly commit. God’s Spirit teaches only that the\n“sin” of self-replacement on the throne of God is <em>not</em> a source of\nguilt. What cannot happen can have <em>no</em> effects to fear. Be quiet in\nyour faith in Him Who loves you and would lead you out of insanity.\nMadness may be your choice, but <em>not</em> your reality. Never forget the\nlove of God, Who <em>has</em> remembered you. For it is quite impossible that\nHe could ever let His Son drop from His loving mind wherein he was\ncreated and where his abode was fixed in perfect peace forever.</p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> Say to the Holy Spirit only, “Decide for me,” and it is done. For His\ndecisions are reflections of what God <em>knows</em> about you, and in this\nlight, error of <em>any</em> kind becomes impossible. Why would you struggle so\nfrantically to anticipate all that you <em>cannot</em> know when all knowledge\nlies behind every decision which the Holy Spirit makes <em>for</em> you? Learn\nof His wisdom and His love and teach His answer to everyone who\nstruggles in the dark. For you decide for them <em>and</em> for yourself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> How gracious is it to decide all things through Him Whose equal love\nis given equally to all alike! He leaves you no one <em>outside</em> yourself,\nalone <em>without</em> you. And so He gives you what is yours because your\nFather would have you share it with Him. In everything be led by Him and\ndo not reconsider. Trust Him to answer quickly, surely, and with love\nfor everyone who will be touched in any way by the decision. And\neveryone <em>will</em> be. Would you take unto yourself the sole responsibility\nfor deciding what can bring <em>only</em> good to everyone? Would you <em>know</em>\nthis?</p>\n\n<p><sup>82</sup> You taught yourselves the most unnatural habit of <em>not</em> communicating\nwith your Creator. Yet you remain in close communication with Him and\nwith everything that is within Him, as it is within yourself. <em>Unlearn</em>\nisolation through His loving guidance and learn of all the happy\ncommunication that you have thrown away but could not lose.</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> Whenever you are in doubt what you should do, think of His Presence\nin you and tell yourself this and <em>only</em> this:</p>\n\n<p><sup>84</sup> <em>He leadeth me and knows the way, which I know not.<br />\nYet He will never <strong>keep</strong> from me what He would have me <strong>learn</strong>.<br />\nAnd so I trust Him to communicate to me all that He knows <strong>for</strong> me.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>85</sup> Then let Him teach you quietly how to perceive your guiltlessness,\nwhich is <em>already</em> there.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>86</sup> When you accept a brother’s guiltlessness, you will see the Atonement\nin him. For by proclaiming it in him, you make it <em>yours</em>, and you\n<em>will</em> see what you sought. You will not see the symbol of your\nbrother’s guiltlessness shining within him while you still believe it is\nnot there. <em>His</em> guiltlessness is <em>your</em> Atonement. Grant it to him, and\nyou will see the truth of what you have acknowledged. Yet truth is\noffered <em>first</em> to be received, even as God gave it first to His Son.\nThe first in time means nothing, but the First in eternity is God the\nFather, Who is both First and One. Beyond the First, there is no other,\nfor there is no order, no second or third and nothing <em>but</em> the First.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> You who belong to the First Cause, created by Him like unto Himself\nand part of Him, are more than merely guiltless. The state of\nguiltlessness is only the condition in which what is not there has been\nremoved from the disordered mind that thought it <em>was</em>. This state, and\nonly this, must <em>you</em> attain with God beside you. For until you do, you\nwill still think that you are separate from Him. You can feel His\nPresence next to you but <em>cannot</em> know that you are one with Him. This\nneed not be taught. Learning applies only to the condition in which it\nhappens <em>of itself</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> When you have let all that obscured the truth in your most holy mind\nbe undone for you and stand in grace before your Father, He will give\nHimself to you as He has always done. Giving Himself is all He knows,\nand so it is all knowledge. For what He knows not cannot be and\ntherefore cannot be given. Ask not to be forgiven, for this has already\nbeen accomplished. Ask, rather, to learn how to <em>forgive</em> and restore\nwhat always was to your unforgiving mind. Atonement becomes real and\nvisible to them that <em>use</em> it. On earth this is your only function, and\nyou must learn that it is all you <em>want</em> to learn.</p>\n\n<p><sup>89</sup> You <em>will</em> feel guilty till you learn this. For in the end, whatever\nform it takes, your guilt arises from your failure to fulfill your\nfunction in God’s Mind with all of <em>yours</em>. Can you escape this guilt by\nfailing to fulfill your function here? You need not understand creation\nto do what must be done before that knowledge would be meaningful to\nyou. God breaks no barriers; neither did He <em>make</em> them. When <em>you</em>\nrelease them, they are gone. God will not fail nor ever has in anything.</p>\n\n<p><sup>90</sup> Decide that God is right and <em>you</em> are wrong about yourself. He\ncreated you out of Himself but still within Him. He <em>knows</em> what you\nare. Remember that there is no second to Him. There cannot, therefore,\nbe anyone without His Holiness nor anyone unworthy of His perfect Love.\nFail not in your function of loving in a loveless place made out of\ndarkness and deceit, for thus are darkness and deceit undone. Fail not\n<em>yourself</em>, but instead offer to God <em>and you</em> His blameless Son. For\nthis small gift of appreciation for His Love, God will Himself exchange\nyour gift for His.</p>\n\n<p><sup>91</sup> Before you make <em>any</em> decisions for yourself, remember that you have\ndecided <em>against</em> your function in Heaven and consider carefully whether\nyou <em>want</em> to make decisions here. Your function here is only to decide\n<em>against</em> deciding what you want in recognition that you do not <em>know.</em>\nHow, then, can you decide what you should do? Leave all decisions to the\nOne Who speaks for God and for your function as He <em>knows</em> it. So will\nHe teach you to remove the awful burden you have laid upon yourself by\nloving not the Son of God and trying to teach him guilt instead of love.\nGive up this frantic and insane attempt, which cheats you of the joy of\nliving with your God and Father, and awaking gladly to His love and\nholiness, which join together as the truth in you, making you one with\nHim.</p>\n\n<p><sup>92</sup> When you have learned how to decide <em>with</em> God, all decisions become\nas easy and as right as breathing. There is no effort, and you will be\nled as gently as if you were being carried along a quiet path in summer.\nOnly your own volition seems to make deciding hard. The Holy Spirit will\nnot delay at all in answering your <em>every</em> question what to do. He\n<em>knows</em>. And He will <em>tell</em> you and then do it <em>for</em> you. You who are\ntired might consider whether this is not more restful than sleep. For\nyou can bring your guilt into sleeping but not into this.</p>\n\n",

And\nonly the Holy Spirit can <em>answer</em> God for you, for only He knows what\nGod <em>is.</em> Everything else that you have placed within your mind <em>cannot</em>\nexist, for what is not in communication with the Mind of God has never\nbeen.

Do not try to steal it from him, or you will <em>ask</em> for\nguilt and <em>will</em> experience it. Protect his purity from every thought\nthat would steal it away and keep it from his sight. Bring innocence to\nlight in answer to the call of the Atonement. Never allow purity to\nremain hidden, but shine away the heavy veils of guilt within which the\nSon of God has hidden himself from his own sight. We are all joined in\nthe Atonement here, and nothing else can unite us in this world. So will\nthe world of separation slip away and full communication be restored\nbetween the Father and the Son.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> The miracle acknowledges the guiltlessness which <em>must</em> have been\ndenied to produce <em>need</em> of healing. Do not withhold this glad\nacknowledgment, for hope of happiness and release from suffering of\nevery kind lie in it. Who is there but wishes to be free of pain? He may\nnot yet have learned <em>how</em> to exchange his guilt for innocence nor\nrealize that only in this exchange can freedom from pain be his. Yet\nthose who have failed to learn need <em>teaching, not</em> attack. To attack\nthose who have need of teaching is to fail to learn from them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> Teachers of innocence, each in his own way, have joined together,\ntaking their part in the unified curriculum of the Atonement. There is\nno unity of learning goals apart from this. There is no conflict in this\ncurriculum, which has <em>one</em> aim however it is taught. Each effort made\non its behalf is offered for the single purpose of <em>release</em> from guilt\nto the eternal glory of God and His creation. And every teaching that\npoints to this points straight to Heaven and to the peace of God. There\nis no pain, no trial, no fear that teaching this can fail to overcome.\nThe power of God Himself supports this teaching and <em>guarantees</em> its\nlimitless results.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> Join your own efforts to the power that <em>cannot</em> fail and <em>must</em>\nresult in peace. No one can be untouched by teaching such as this. You\nwill not see yourself beyond the power of God if you teach only this.\nYou will not be exempt from the effects of this most holy lesson, which\nseeks but to restore what is the right of God’s creation. From everyone\nwhom you accord release from guilt, you will inevitably learn <em>your</em>\ninnocence. The circle of Atonement <em>has</em> no end. And you will find\never-increasing confidence in your safe inclusion in what is for all in\neveryone you bring within its safety and its perfect peace.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> Peace, then, be unto everyone who becomes a teacher of peace. For\npeace is the acknowledgment of perfect purity from which no one is\nexcluded. Within its holy circle is everyone whom God created as His\nSon. Joy is its unifying attribute, with no one left outside to suffer\nguilt alone. The power of God draws everyone to its safe embrace of love\nand union. Stand quietly within this circle and attract all tortured\nminds to join with you in the safety of its peace and holiness. Abide\nwith me within it as teachers of Atonement, <em>not</em> of guilt.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> Blessed are you who teach with me. Our power comes not of us but of\nour Father. In guiltlessness we know Him, as He knows us guiltless. I\nstand within the circle, calling you to peace. Teach peace with me and\nstand with me on holy ground. Remember for everyone your Father’s power\nthat He has given him. Believe not that you cannot teach His perfect\npeace. Stand not outside but join with me within. Fail not the only\npurpose to which my teaching calls you. Restore to God His Son as He\ncreated him by teaching him his innocence.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> The crucifixion has no part in the Atonement. Only the resurrection\nbecame my part in it. That is the symbol of the release from guilt by\nguiltlessness. Whom you perceive as guilty, you would crucify. Yet you\n<em>restore</em> guiltlessness to whomever you see as guiltless. Crucifixion is\n<em>always</em> the ego’s aim. It sees <em>as guilty</em>, and by its condemnation, it\nwould kill. The Holy Spirit sees only guiltlessness, and in His\ngentleness, He would release from fear and reestablish the reign of\nlove. The power of love is in His gentleness, which is of God and\ntherefore cannot crucify nor suffer crucifixion. The temple you restore\nbecomes <em>your</em> altar, for it was rebuilt through you. And everything you\ngive to God <em>is</em> yours. Thus He creates, and thus must <em>you</em> restore.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> Each one you see you place within the holy circle of Atonement or\nleave outside, judging him fit for crucifixion or for redemption. If you\nbring him <em>into</em> the circle of purity, you will rest there with him. If\nyou leave him <em>without</em>, you join him there. Judge not except in\nquietness which is not of you. Refuse to accept anyone as <em>without</em> the\nblessing of Atonement, and bring him <em>into</em> it by blessing him. Holiness\nmust be shared, for therein lies everything that makes it holy. Come\ngladly to the holy circle, and look out in peace on all who think they\nare outside. Cast no one out, for this is what he seeks, along with you.\nCome, let us join him in the holy place of peace, which is for all of\nus, united as one within the cause of peace.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>16</sup> The journey that we undertake together is the exchange of dark for\nlight, of ignorance for understanding. Nothing you understand is\nfearful. It is only in darkness and in ignorance that you perceive the\nfrightening, and you shrink away from it to further darkness. And yet it\nis only the hidden that can terrify, not for what it <em>is</em>, but for its\nhiddenness. The obscure is frightening <em>because</em> you do not understand\nits meaning. If you did, it would be clear, and you would be no longer\nin the dark. Nothing has <em>hidden</em> value, for what is hidden cannot be\nshared, and so its value is unknown. The hidden is <em>kept apart</em>, but\nvalue always lies in joint appreciation. What is concealed cannot be\nloved, and so it <em>must</em> be feared.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> The quiet light in which the Holy Spirit dwells within you is merely\nperfect openness in which nothing is hidden and therefore nothing is\nfearful. Attack will <em>always</em> yield to love if it is <em>brought</em> to love,\nnot hidden <em>from</em> it. There is no darkness that the light of love will\nnot dispel, unless it is concealed from love’s beneficence. What is kept\n<em>apart</em> from love cannot share its healing power, because it has been\nseparated off and kept in darkness. The sentinels of darkness watch over\nit carefully, and you who made these guardians of illusion out of\nnothing are now afraid of them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> Would you <em>continue</em> to give imagined power to these strange ideas of\nsafety? They are neither safe nor unsafe. They do not protect; neither\ndo they attack. They do nothing at all, <em>being</em> nothing at all. As\nguardians of darkness and of ignorance, look to them only for fear, for\nwhat they keep obscure <em>is</em> fearful. But let them go, and what was\nfearful will be so no longer. Without protection of obscurity, <em>only</em>\nthe light of love remains, for only this <em>has</em> meaning and <em>can</em> live in\nlight. Everything else <em>must</em> disappear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> Death yields to life simply because destruction is not <em>true.</em> The\nlight of guiltlessness shines guilt away because, when they are brought\n<em>together</em>, the truth of one <em>must</em> make the falsity of its opposite\nperfectly clear. Keep not guilt and guiltlessness apart, for your belief\nthat you can have them <em>both</em> is meaningless. All you have done by\nkeeping them apart is lose their meaning by confusing them with each\nother. And so you do not realize that only one means anything, and the\nother is wholly without sense of <em>any</em> kind.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> You have interpreted the separation as a means which you have made\nfor breaking your communication with your Father. The Holy Spirit\nreinterprets it as a means of reestablishing what has not been broken\nbut <em>has</em> been made obscure. All things you made have use to Him for His\nmost holy purpose. He <em>knows</em> you are not separate from God, but He\nperceives much in your mind that lets you <em>think</em> you are. All this, and\nnothing else, would He separate from you. The power of decision, which\nyou made <em>in place</em> of the power of creation, He would teach you how to\nuse on your <em>behalf.</em> You who made it to crucify yourselves must learn\nof Him how to apply it to the holy cause of restoration.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> You who speak in dark and devious symbols do not understand the\nlanguage you have made. It <em>has</em> no meaning, for its purpose is not\ncommunication, but rather the <em>disruption</em> of communication. If the\npurpose of language <em>is</em> communication, how can this tongue mean\nanything? Yet even this strange and twisted effort to communicate\nthrough <em>not</em> communicating holds enough of love to <em>make</em> it meaningful\nif its interpreter is <em>not</em> its maker. You who made it are but\nexpressing conflict, from which the Holy Spirit would release you. Leave\nwhat you would communicate to Him. He will interpret it to you with\nperfect clarity, for He knows with Whom you <em>are</em> in perfect\ncommunication.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> You know not what you say, and so you know not what is said to you.\nYet your Interpreter perceives the meaning in your alien language. He\nwill not attempt to communicate the meaningless. But He <em>will</em> separate\nout all that has meaning, dropping off the rest and offering your true\ncommunication to those who would communicate as truly with you. You\nspeak two languages at once, and this <em>must</em> lead to unintelligibility.\nYet if one means nothing and the other everything, only that one is\npossible for purposes of communication. The other but <em>interferes</em> with\nit.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> The Holy Spirit’s function is <em>entirely</em> communication. He therefore\nmust remove whatever interferes with it in order to <em>restore</em> it.\nTherefore, keep no source of interference from His sight, for He will\nnot attack your sentinels. But bring them to Him, and let His gentleness\nteach you that in the light they are not fearful and <em>cannot</em> serve to\nguard the dark doors behind which nothing at all is carefully concealed.\nWe must open all doors and let the light come streaming through. There\nare no hidden chambers in God’s temple. Its gates are open wide to greet\nHis Son. No one can fail to come where God has called him if he close\nnot the door himself upon his Father’s welcome.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>24</sup> What do you <em>want</em>? Light or darkness, knowledge or ignorance are\nyours, but not both. Opposites must be brought together and not kept\napart. For their separation is only in your mind, and they are\nreconciled by union, as <em>you</em> are. In union, everything that is not real\n<em>must</em> disappear, for truth <em>is</em> union. As darkness disappears in light,\nso ignorance fades away when knowledge dawns. Perception is the medium\nby which ignorance is brought to knowledge. Yet the perception must be\nwithout deceit, for otherwise it becomes the messenger of ignorance\nrather than a helper in the search for truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> The search for truth is but the honest searching out of everything\nthat interferes with truth. Truth <em>is</em>. It can be neither lost nor\nsought nor found. It is there, wherever <em>you</em> are, being <em>within</em> you.\nYet it <em>can</em> be recognized or unrecognized, real or false to <em>you</em>. If\nyou hide it, it becomes unreal to you <em>because</em> you hid it and\nsurrounded it with fear. Under each cornerstone of fear on which you\nhave erected your insane system of belief, the truth lies hidden. Yet\nyou cannot know this, for by hiding truth in fear, you see no reason to\nbelieve the <em>more</em> you look at fear, the <em>less</em> you see it, and the\nclearer what it <em>conceals</em> becomes.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> It is not possible to convince the unknowing that they know. From\ntheir point of view, it is not true. Yet it <em>is</em> true because <em>God</em>\nknows it. These are clearly opposite viewpoints of what the “unknowing”\nare. To God, unknowing is impossible. It is therefore not a point of\nview at all but merely a belief in something that does not exist. It is\nonly this belief that the unknowing have, and by it they are wrong about\nthemselves. They have <em>defined</em> themselves as they were not created.\nTheir creation was not a point of view, but rather a certainty.\nUncertainty brought to certainty does not retain <em>any</em> conviction of\nreality.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> You must have noticed that the emphasis has been on bringing what is\nundesirable <em>to</em> the desirable; what you do <em>not</em> want to what you <em>do</em>.\nYou will realize that salvation must come to you this way if you\nconsider what dissociation is. Dissociation is a distorted process of\nthinking whereby two systems of belief which cannot coexist are both\n<em>maintained</em>. It has <em>been</em> recognized that if they were brought\n<em>together</em> their joint acceptance would become impossible. But if one is\nkept in darkness from the other, their <em>separation</em> seems to keep them\nboth alive and equal in their reality. Their joining thus becomes the\nsource of fear, for if they meet, acceptance <em>must</em> be withdrawn from\none of them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> You <em>cannot</em> have them both, for each denies the other. Apart, this\nfact is lost from sight, for each in a <em>separate</em> place can be endowed\nwith firm belief. Bring them <em>together</em>, and the fact of their complete\nincompatibility is instantly apparent. One will go <em>because</em> the other\nis seen in the same place. Light cannot enter darkness when a mind\nbelieves in darkness and will not <em>let</em> it go. Truth does not struggle\nagainst ignorance, and love does not attack fear. What needs no\nprotection does not defend itself. Defense is of <em>your</em> making. God\nknows it not. The Holy Spirit uses defenses on <em>behalf</em> of truth only\nbecause you made them <em>against</em> it. His perception of them, according to\nHis purpose, merely changes them into a call <em>for</em> what you have\n<em>attacked</em> with them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> Defenses, like everything you made, must be gently turned to your own\ngood, translated by the Holy Spirit from means of self-destruction to\nmeans of preservation and release. His task is mighty, but the power of\nGod is with Him. Therefore, to Him it is so easy that it was\naccomplished the instant it was given Him for you. Do not delay\nyourselves in your return to peace by wondering how He can fulfill what\nGod has given Him to do. Leave that to Him Who knows. You are not asked\nto do mighty tasks yourself. You are merely asked to do the little He\nsuggests you do, trusting Him only to the small extent of believing that\nif He asks it, you <em>can</em> do it. You will <em>see</em> how easily all that He\nasks can be accomplished.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> The Holy Spirit asks of you but this—bring to Him every secret you\nhave locked away from Him. Open every door to Him and bid Him enter the\ndarkness and lighten it away. At your request He enters gladly. He\nbrings the light to darkness if you make the darkness <em>open</em> to Him. But\nwhat you hide He cannot look upon. For He sees for <em>you</em>, and unless you\nlook <em>with</em> Him, He cannot see. The vision of Christ is not for Him\nalone but for Him with <em>you</em>. Bring, therefore, all your dark and secret\nthoughts to Him and look upon them <em>with</em> Him. He holds the light, and\nyou the darkness. They <em>cannot</em> coexist when both of you together look\non them. His judgment <em>must</em> prevail, and He will <em>give</em> it to you as\nyou join your perception to His. Joining with Him in seeing is the way\nin which you learn to share with Him the interpretation of perception\nthat leads to knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> You cannot see alone. Sharing perception with Him Whom God has given\nyou teaches you how to <em>recognize</em> what you see. It is the recognition\nthat nothing you see means <em>anything</em> alone. Seeing with Him will show\nyou that all meaning, including <em>yours</em>, comes not from double vision\nbut from the gentle fusing of everything into <em>one</em> meaning, <em>one</em>\nemotion, and <em>one</em> purpose. God has one purpose which He shares with\nyou. The single vision which the Holy Spirit offers you will bring this\noneness to your mind with clarity and brightness so intense you could\nnot wish for all the world not to accept what God would have you have.\nBehold your will, accepting it as His, with all His love as yours. All\nhonor to you through Him, and through Him unto God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> In the darkness you have obscured the glory God gave you and the\npower He bestowed upon His guiltless Son. All this lies hidden in every\ndarkened place shrouded in guilt and in the dark denial of innocence.\nBehind the dark doors which you have closed lies nothing, because\nnothing <em>can</em> obscure the gift of God. It is the closing of the doors\nthat interferes with recognition of the power of God that shines in you.\nBanish not power from your mind, but let all that would hide your glory\nbe brought to the judgment of the Holy Spirit and there undone. Whom He\nwould save for glory <em>is</em> saved for it. He has promised the Father that\nthrough Him you would be released from littleness to glory. To what He\npromised God He is wholly faithful, for He shared with God the promise\nthat was given Him to share with <em>you.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> He shares it still, for <em>you</em>. Everything that promises otherwise,\ngreat or small, however much or little valued, He will replace with the\n<em>one</em> promise given unto Him to lay upon the altar to your Father and\nHis Son. No altar stands to God <em>without</em> His Son. And nothing brought\nthere that is not equally worthy of both but will be replaced by gifts\nwholly acceptable to Father <em>and</em> to Son. Can you offer guilt to God?\nYou cannot, then, offer it to His Son. For they are not apart, and gifts\nto one <em>are</em> offered to the other.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> You know not God because you know not this. And yet you <em>do</em> know God\nand <em>also</em> this. All this is safe within you, where the Holy Spirit\nshines. He shines not in division, but in the meeting place where God,\nunited with His Son, speaks to His Son through Him. Communication\nbetween what cannot be divided <em>cannot</em> cease. The holy meeting place of\nthe unseparated Father and His Son lies in the Holy Spirit and in <em>you</em>.\nAll interference in the communication that God Himself wills with His\nSon is quite impossible here. Unbroken and uninterrupted love flows\nconstantly between the Father and the Son, as <em>both</em> would have it be.\nAnd so it <em>is</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> Let your minds wander not through darkened corridors, away from\nlight’s center. You may choose to lead yourselves astray, but you can\nonly be brought <em>together</em> by the Guide appointed for you. He will\nsurely lead you to where God and His Son await your recognition. They\nare joined in giving you the gift of oneness, before which <em>all</em>\nseparation vanishes. Unite with what you <em>are.</em> You <em>cannot</em> join with\nanything except reality. God’s glory and His Son’s belong to you in\ntruth. They <em>have</em> no opposite, and nothing else <em>can</em> you bestow upon\nyourselves.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> There is no substitute for truth. And truth will make this plain to\nyou as you are brought into the place where you must <em>meet</em> with truth.\nAnd there you must be led, through gentle understanding which can lead\nyou nowhere else. Where God is, there are <em>you</em>. Such <em>is</em> the truth.\nNothing can change the knowledge given you by God into unknowingness.\nEverything God created knows its Creator. For this is how creation is\naccomplished by the Creator and by His creations. In the holy meeting\nplace are joined the Father and His creations, and the creations of His\nSon with them together. There is one link which joins them all together,\nholding them in the oneness out of which creation happens.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> The link with which the Father joins Himself to those He gives the\npower to create like Him can <em>never</em> be dissolved. Heaven itself is\nunion with all of creation and with its One Creator. And Heaven remains\nthe Will of God for you. Lay no gifts other than this upon your altars,\nfor nothing can coexist beside it. Here your meager offerings are\nbrought together with the gift of God, and only what is worthy of the\nFather will be accepted by the Son, for whom it was intended. To whom\nGod gives Himself, He <em>is</em> given. Your little gifts will vanish on the\naltar where He has placed His Own.</p>\n\n",

Keep not your making from your\nFather, for hiding it has cost you knowledge of Him and of yourselves.\nThe knowledge is safe, but wherein is <em>your</em> safety apart from it? The\nmaking of time to <em>take the place</em> of timelessness lay in the decision\nto be not as you were. Thus, truth was made past, and the present was\ndedicated to illusion. And the past, too, was changed and interposed\nbetween what always was and <em>now</em>. The past which <em>you</em> remember <em>never</em>\nwas and represents only the denial of what <em>always</em> was.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> Bringing the ego to God is but to bring error to truth, where it\nstands corrected because it is the <em>opposite</em> of what it meets and is\nundone, because the contradiction can no longer stand.

Different realities are meaningless, for reality must be one.\nIt <em>cannot</em> change with time or mood or chance. Its changelessness is\nwhat <em>makes</em> it real.

The\nAtonement offers you God. The gift which you refused is held by Him in\nyou. His Spirit holds it there for you. God has not left His altar,\nthough His worshiper placed other gods upon it. The temple still is\nholy, for the Presence that dwells within it <em>is</em> Holiness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> In the temple Holiness waits quietly for the return of them that love\nit. The Presence knows they will return to purity and to grace. The\ngraciousness of God will take them gently in and cover all their sense\nof pain and loss with the immortal assurance of their Father’s Love.\nThere, fear of death will be replaced with joy of living. For God is\nLife, and they <em>abide</em> in Life. [Life is as holy as the Holiness by\nWhich it was created.] The Presence of Holiness lives in everything\nthat lives, for Holiness <em>created</em> life and leaves not what It created\nholy as Itself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> In this world you can become a spotless mirror in which the Holiness\nof your Creator shines forth from you to all around you. You can reflect\nHeaven <em>here</em>. Yet no reflections of the images of other gods must dim\nthe mirror that would hold God’s reflection in it. Earth can reflect\nHeaven or hell; God or the ego. You need but leave the mirror clean and\nclear of all the images of hidden darkness you have drawn upon it. God\nwill shine upon it of Himself. Only the clear reflection of Himself can\n<em>be</em> perceived upon it. Reflections are seen in light. In darkness they\nare obscure, and their meaning seems to lie only in shifting\ninterpretations rather than in themselves.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> The reflection of God <em>needs</em> no interpretation. It is <em>clear.</em> Clean\nbut the mirror, and the message which shines forth from what the mirror\nholds out for everyone to see no one can <em>fail</em> to understand. It is the\nmessage that the Holy Spirit is holding to the mirror that is in him. He\nrecognizes it because he has been taught his <em>need</em> for it but knows not\nwhere to look to find it. Let him, then, see it in <em>you</em> and <em>share</em> it\nwith you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> Could you but realize for a single instant the power of healing that\nthe reflection of God, shining in you, can bring to all the world, you\ncould not wait to make the mirror of your mind clean to receive the\nimage of the holiness that heals the world. The image of holiness which\nshines in your mind is not obscure and will not change. Its meaning to\nthose who look upon it is not obscure, for everyone perceives it as the\n<em>same</em>. All bring their different problems to its healing light, but all\ntheir problems are met <em>only</em> with healing there.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> The response of holiness to <em>any</em> form of error is always the same.\nThere is no contradiction in what holiness calls forth. Its <em>one</em>\nresponse is healing, without regard for what is brought to it. Those who\nhave learned to offer only healing because of the reflection of holiness\nin them are ready at last for Heaven. There, holiness is not a\nreflection but rather the actual condition of what was but reflected to\nthem here. God is no image, and His creations, as part of Him, hold Him\nin them in truth.

Reach out of time and touch it, with the help of its\nreflection in you. And you will turn from time to holiness as surely as\nthe reflection of holiness calls everyone to lay all guilt aside.\nReflect the peace of Heaven <em>here</em> and bring this world to Heaven. For\nthe reflection of truth draws everyone <em>to</em> truth, and as they enter\ninto it, they leave all reflections behind.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> In Heaven reality is shared and not reflected. By sharing its\nreflection here, its truth becomes the only perception the Son of God\naccepts. And thus, remembrance of his Father dawns on him, and he can no\nlonger be satisfied with anything but his own reality. You on earth have\nno conception of limitlessness, for the world you seem to live in <em>is</em> a\nworld of limits. In this world, it is not true that anything without\norder of difficulty can occur. The miracle, therefore, has a unique\nfunction and is motivated by a unique Teacher, Who brings the laws of\nanother world to this one. The miracle is the <em>one</em> thing you can do\nthat transcends order, being based not on differences but on equality.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> Miracles are not in competition, and the number of them that you can\ndo is limitless.

From the world’s viewpoint, this is impossible. You have\nexperienced lack of competition among your thoughts, which, even though\nthey may conflict, can occur to you together and in great numbers. You\nare so used to this that it can cause you little surprise.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> Yet you are also used to classifying some of your thoughts as more\nimportant, larger or better, wiser or more productive and valuable than\nothers.

It shifts unceasingly across the mirror of your mind, and the\nreflections of Heaven last but a moment and grow dim as darkness blots\nthem out. Where there was light, darkness removes it in an instant, and\nalternating patterns of light and darkness sweep constantly across your\nminds.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> The little sanity which still remains is held together by a sense of\norder which <em>you</em> establish. Yet the very fact that you can <em>do</em> this\nand bring <em>any</em> order into chaos shows you that you are not an ego and\nthat more than an ego <em>must</em> be in you. For the ego <em>is</em> chaos, and if\nit were all of you, no order at all would be possible. Yet though the\norder which you impose upon your minds limits the ego, it <em>also</em> limits\n<em>you</em>. To order is to judge and to arrange <em>by</em> judgment. [Therefore,\nit is not your function, but the Holy Spirit’s.] It will seem difficult\nfor you to learn that you have no basis <em>at all</em> for ordering your\nthoughts. This lesson the Holy Spirit teaches by giving you shining\nexamples to show you that your way of ordering is wrong, but that a\nbetter way is offered you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> The miracle offers exactly the same response to every call for help.\nIt does not judge the call. It merely recognizes what it <em>is</em> and\nanswers accordingly. It does not consider which call is louder or\ngreater or more important. You may wonder how you who are still bound to\njudgment can be asked to do that which requires no judgment of your own.\nThe answer is very simple. The power of God, and <em>not</em> of you, engenders\nmiracles. The miracle itself is but the witness that you have the power\nof God in you. That is the reason why the miracle gives equal blessing\nto all who share in it, and that is also why <em>everyone</em> shares in it.\nThe power of God is limitless. And being always maximal, it offers\n<em>everything</em> to <em>every</em> call from <em>anyone</em>. There <em>is</em> no order of\ndifficulty here. A call for help is given help.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> The only judgment involved at all is the Holy Spirit’s <em>one</em> division\ninto two categories—one of love and the other the call for love. <em>You</em>\ncannot safely make this division, for you are much too confused either\nto recognize love or to believe that everything else is nothing but a\nneed for love. You are too bound to form and not to content. What you\nconsider content is not content at all. It is merely form, and nothing\nelse. For you do not respond to what a brother <em>really</em> offers you, but\nonly to the particular perception of his offering by which the ego\njudges it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> The ego is incapable of understanding content and is totally\nunconcerned with it. To the ego, if the form is acceptable, the content\n<em>must</em> be. Otherwise, it will attack the form. You who believe you\nunderstand something of the dynamics of the mind, let me assure you that\nyou know nothing of it at all. For of yourselves you <em>could</em> not know of\nit. The study of the ego is <em>not</em> the study of the mind. In fact, the\nego enjoys the study of itself and thoroughly approves the undertakings\nof students who would analyze it, approving its importance. Yet they but\nstudy form with meaningless content. For their teacher is senseless,\nthough careful to conceal this fact behind a lot of words which sound\nimpressive but which lack any consistent sense when they are put\n<em>together</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> This is characteristic of the ego’s judgments. Separately, they seem\nto hold, but put them together and the system of thought which arises\nfrom joining them is incoherent and utterly chaotic. For form is not\nenough for meaning, and the underlying lack of content makes a cohesive\nsystem impossible. Separation therefore remains the ego’s chosen\ncondition. For no one alone can judge the ego truly. Yet when two or\nmore <em>join together</em> in searching for truth, the ego can no longer\ndefend its lack of content. The fact of union <em>tells</em> them it is not\ntrue.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> It is impossible to remember God in secret and alone. For remembering\nHim means you are <em>not</em> alone and willing to remember it. Take no\nthought for yourself, for no thought you hold <em>is</em> for yourself. If you\nwould remember your Father, let the Holy Spirit order your thoughts and\ngive only the answer with which He answers you. Everyone seeks for love\nas you do and knows it not unless he joins with you in seeking it. If\nyou undertake the search together, you bring with you a light so\npowerful that what you see is <em>given</em> meaning. The lonely journey fails\nbecause it has excluded what it would <em>find</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> As God communicates to the Holy Spirit in you, so does the Holy\nSpirit translate His communications <em>through</em> you so <em>you</em> can\nunderstand them. God has no secret communications, for everything of Him\nis perfectly open and freely accessible to all, being <em>for</em> all. Nothing\nlives in secret, and what you would hide from the Holy Spirit is\nnothing. Every interpretation <em>you</em> would lay upon a brother is\nsenseless. Let the Holy Spirit <em>show</em> him to you and teach you both his\nlove and need for love. Neither his mind <em>nor yours</em> holds more than\nthese two orders of thought.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> The miracle is the recognition that this is true. Where there is\nlove, your brother must give it to you because of what it <em>is</em>. But\nwhere there is <em>need</em> for love, <em>you</em> must give it because of what <em>you</em>\nare. Long ago we said this course will teach you what you are, restoring\nto you your identity. We have already learned that this identity is\nshared. The miracle becomes the <em>means</em> of sharing it. By supplying your\nidentity wherever it is <em>not</em> recognized, <em>you</em> will recognize it. And\nGod Himself, Who wills to be with His Son forever, will bless each\nrecognition of His Son with all the love He holds for him. Nor will the\npower of <em>all</em> His love be absent from any miracle you offer to His Son.\nHow, then, can there be any order of difficulty among them?</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>58</sup> Yet the essential thing is learning that <em>you do not know</em>. Knowledge\nis power, and all power is of God. You who have tried to keep power for\nyourselves have lost it. You still have the power, but you have\ninterposed so much between it and your <em>awareness</em> of it that you cannot\nuse it. Everything you have taught yourselves has made your power more\nand more obscure to you. You know not <em>what</em> it is nor <em>where</em>. You have\nmade a semblance of power and a show of strength so pitiful that it\n<em>must</em> fail you. For power is not a seeming strength, and truth is\nbeyond semblance of any kind. Yet all that stands between you and the\npower of God in you is but your learning of the false and your attempts\nto undo the true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> Be willing, then, for all of it to be undone, and be glad that you\nare not bound to it forever. For you have taught yourselves how to\nimprison the Son of God, a lesson so unthinkable that only the insane,\nin deepest sleep, could even dream of it. Can God learn how <em>not</em> to be\nGod? And can His Son, given all power by Him, learn to be powerless?\nWhat have you taught yourselves that you can possibly prefer to keep in\nplace of what you <em>have</em> and what you <em>are</em>?</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> Atonement teaches you how to escape forever from everything that you\nhave taught yourselves in the past by showing you only what you are\n<em>now</em>. Learning <em>has been</em> accomplished before its effects are manifest.\nLearning is therefore in the past, but its influence determines the\npresent by giving it whatever meaning it holds for you. <em>Your</em> learning\ngives the present no meaning at all. Nothing you have ever learned can\nhelp you understand the present or teach you how to undo the past. Your\npast <em>is</em> what you have taught yourselves. <em>Let it all go</em>. Do not\nattempt to understand any event or anything or anyone in its light, for\nthe light of darkness by which you try to see can <em>only</em> obscure.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> Put no confidence at all in darkness to illuminate your\nunderstanding, for if you do, you contradict the light and thereby\n<em>think</em> you see the darkness. Yet darkness cannot <em>be</em> seen, for it is\nnothing more than a condition in which seeing becomes impossible. You\nwho have not yet brought all of the darkness you have taught yourselves\nunto the light in you can hardly judge the truth and value of this\ncourse. Yet God did not abandon you. And so you have another lesson sent\nfrom Him, <em>already</em> learned for every Child of light by Him to Whom God\ngave it. This lesson shines with God’s glory, for in it lies His power,\nwhich He shares so gladly with His Son.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> Learn of His happiness, which is <em>yours</em>. But to accomplish this, all\nyour dark lessons must be brought willingly to truth and joyously laid\ndown by hands open to receive, not closed to take. Every dark lesson\nthat you bring to Him Who teaches light He will accept from you because\nyou do not want it. And He will gladly <em>exchange</em> each one for the\nbright lesson He has learned for you. Never believe that any lesson you\nhave learned <em>apart</em> from Him means anything.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> You have one test, as sure as God, by which to recognize if what you\nlearned is true. If you are wholly free of fear of any kind, and if all\nthose who meet or even think of you share in your perfect peace, then\nyou can be sure that you have learned God’s lesson and not yours. Unless\nall this is true, there <em>are</em> dark lessons in your minds which hurt and\nhinder you and everyone around you. The <em>absence</em> of perfect peace means\nbut <em>one</em> thing: you <em>think</em> you do not will for God’s Son what His\nFather wills for him. Every dark lesson teaches this in one form or\nanother. And each bright lesson, with which the Holy Spirit will replace\nthe dark ones you do not accept and hide, teaches you that you will\n<em>with</em> the Father unto His Son.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> Do not be concerned how you can learn a lesson so completely\ndifferent from everything you have taught yourselves. How would you\nknow? Your part is very simple. You need only recognize that everything\nyou learned you do not <em>want</em>. Ask to be <em>taught</em> and do not use your\nexperiences to confirm what <em>you</em> have learned. When your peace is\nthreatened or disturbed in any way, say to yourself,</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> <em>I do not know what anything, <strong>including this,</strong> means.<br />\nAnd so I do not know how to respond to it.<br />\nAnd I will not use my own past learning as the light to guide me now.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> By this refusal to attempt to teach yourself what you do not know,\nthe Guide Whom God has given you will speak to you. He will take His\nrightful place in your awareness the instant <em>you</em> abandon it and offer\nit to Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> <em>You</em> cannot be your guide to miracles, for it is you who made them\nnecessary. And <em>because</em> you did, the means on which you can depend for\nmiracles has been provided <em>for</em> you. God’s Son can make no needs His\nFather will not meet if he but turn to Him ever so little. Yet He cannot\ncompel His Son to turn to Him and remain Himself. It is impossible that\nGod lose His Identity, for if He did, you would lose <em>yours</em>. And being\nyours, He cannot change Himself, for your identity <em>is</em> changeless. The\nmiracle acknowledges His changelessness by seeing His Son as he always\nwas and not as he would make himself. The miracle brings the effects\nwhich <em>only</em> guiltlessness can bring and thus establishes the fact that\nguiltlessness must <em>be</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> How can you, so firmly bound to guilt and committed so to remain,\nestablish for yourself your guiltlessness? That is impossible. But be\nsure that you are willing to acknowledge that it <em>is</em> impossible. It is\nonly because you think that you can run some little part or deal with\ncertain aspects of your lives alone that the guidance of the Holy Spirit\nis limited. Thus would you make <em>Him</em> undependable and use this fancied\nundependability as an excuse for keeping certain dark lessons from Him.\nAnd by so limiting the guidance that you would <em>accept</em>, you are unable\nto depend on miracles to answer all your problems for you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> Do you think that what the Holy Spirit would have you <em>give</em> He would\n<em>withhold</em> from you? You have <em>no</em> problems which He cannot solve by\noffering you a miracle. Miracles are for <em>you</em>. And every fear or pain\nor trial you have <em>has been</em> undone. He has brought all of them to\nlight, having accepted them <em>instead</em> of you and recognized they never\nwere. There are no dark lessons He has not <em>already</em> lightened for you.\nThe lessons you would teach yourselves He has corrected already. They do\nnot exist in His Mind at all. For the past binds Him not and therefore\nbinds not you. He does not see time as you do. And each miracle He\noffers you corrects your use of time and makes it His.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> He Who has freed you from the past would teach you <em>are</em> free of it.\nHe would but have you accept His accomplishments as <em>yours</em> because he\ndid them <em>for</em> you. And because he did, they <em>are</em> yours. He has made\nyou free of what you made. You can deny Him, but you <em>cannot</em> call on\nHim in vain. He <em>always</em> gives what He has made <em>in place</em> of you. He\nwould establish His bright teaching so firmly in your mind that no dark\nlessons of guilt can abide in what He has established as holy by His\nPresence. Thank God that He is there and works through you. And all His\nworks are yours. He offers you a miracle with every one you let Him do\nthrough you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> God’s Son will <em>always</em> be indivisible. As we are held as one in God,\nso do we learn as one in Him. God’s Teacher is as like to His Creator as\nis His Son, and through His Teacher does God proclaim His Oneness <em>and</em>\nHis Son’s. Listen in silence, and do not raise your voice against Him.\nFor He teaches the miracle of oneness, and before His lesson division\ndisappears. Teach like Him here, and you will remember that you have\n<em>always</em> created like your Father. The miracle of creation has never\nceased, having the holy stamp of immortality upon it. This is the Will\nof God for all creation, and all creation joins in willing this.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> Those who remember always that they know nothing, but who have become\nwilling to learn <em>everything</em>, will learn it. But whenever they trust\nthemselves, they will <em>not</em> learn. They have destroyed their motivation\nfor learning by thinking they <em>already</em> know. Think not you understand\nanything until you pass the test of perfect peace, for peace and\nunderstanding go together and never can be found alone. Each brings the\nother <em>with</em> it, for it is the law of God they be not separate. They are\ncause and effect, each to the other, so where one is absent the other\n<em>cannot</em> be.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> Only those who see they cannot know <em>unless</em> the effects of\nunderstanding are with them can really learn at all. And for this, it\nmust be peace they <em>want</em> and nothing else. Whenever you think <em>you</em>\nknow, peace will depart from you because you have abandoned the Teacher\nof Peace. Whenever you fully realize that you know <em>not</em>, peace will\nreturn, for you will have invited Him to do so by abandoning the ego on\nbehalf of Him. Call not upon the ego for anything. It is only <em>this</em>\nthat you need do. The Holy Spirit will, of <em>Himself</em>, fill every mind\nthat so makes room for Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> If you want peace, you must abandon the teacher of attack. The\nTeacher of peace will <em>never</em> abandon you. You can desert Him, but He\nwill never reciprocate, for His faith in you <em>is</em> His understanding. It\nis as firm as is His faith in His Creator, and He knows that faith in\nHis Creator <em>must</em> encompass faith in His creation. In this consistency\nlies His holiness, which He cannot abandon, for it is not His Will to do\nso. With your perfection ever in His sight, He gives the gift of peace\nto everyone who perceives the need for peace and who would have it. Make\nway for peace, and it will come. For understanding is in you, and from\nit peace <em>must</em> come.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> The power of God, from which they both arise, is yours as surely as\nit is His. You think you know Him not only because, alone, it is\nimpossible to know Him. Yet see the mighty works that He will do through\nyou, and you must be convinced you did them through Him. It is\nimpossible to deny the Source of effects so powerful they <em>could</em> not be\nof you. Leave room for Him, and you will find yourself so filled with\npower that <em>nothing</em> will prevail against your peace. And this will be\nthe test by which you recognize that you have understood.</p>\n\n",

It does not waste Him as it does you.] And all the waste\nthat time seems to bring with it is due but to your identification with\nthe ego, which uses time to support its belief in destruction. The ego,\nlike the Holy Spirit, uses time to convince you of the inevitability of\nthe goal and end of teaching. To the ego the goal is death, which <em>is</em>\nits end.

  {
    "content": "<p><sup>3</sup> The ego is an ally of time, but not a friend. For it is as mistrustful\nof death as it is of life, and what it wants for you it cannot tolerate.\nThe ego wants <em>you</em> dead, but <em>not</em> itself. The outcome of its strange\nreligion must therefore be the conviction that it can pursue you beyond\nthe grave. And out of its unwillingness for you to find peace even in\nthe death it wants for you, it offers you immortality in hell. It speaks\nto you of Heaven but assures you that Heaven is not for you. How can the\nguilty hope for Heaven? The belief in hell is inescapable to those who\nidentify with the ego. Their nightmares and their fears are all\nassociated with it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup> The ego teaches that hell is in the <em>future</em>, for this is what all its\nteaching is directed to. Hell is its <em>goal</em>, for although the ego aims\nat death and dissolution as an end, it does not <em>believe</em> it. The goal\nof death, which it craves for you, leaves it unsatisfied. No one who\nfollows the ego’s teaching is without the fear of death. Yet if death\nwere thought of merely as an end to pain, would it be <em>feared</em>? We have\nseen this strange paradox in the ego’s thought system before, but never\nso clearly as here. For the ego must seem to <em>keep</em> fear from you to\nkeep your allegiance. Yet it must <em>engender</em> fear in order to maintain\n<em>itself</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> Again the ego tries and all too frequently succeeds in doing both by\nusing dissociation for holding its contradictory aims together so that\nthey <em>seem</em> to be reconciled. The ego teaches thus: Death is the end as\nfar as hope of Heaven goes. Yet because you and itself cannot be\nseparated, and because it cannot conceive of its <em>own</em> death, it will\npursue you still because guilt is eternal. Such is the ego’s version of\nimmortality. And it is this the ego’s version of time supports.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> The ego teaches that Heaven is here and now because the <em>future</em> is\nhell. Even when it attacks so savagely that it tries to take the life of\nsomeone who hears it temporarily as the <em>only</em> voice, it speaks of hell\neven to him. For it tells him hell is <em>here</em> and bids him leap from hell\ninto oblivion. The only time the ego allows anyone to look upon with\nsome amount of equanimity is the past. And even there its only value is\nthat it is no more.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> How bleak and despairing is the ego’s use of time! And how terrifying!\nFor underneath its fanatical insistence that the past and future be the\nsame is hidden a far more insidious threat to peace. The ego does not\nadvertise its final threat, for it would have its worshipers still\nbelieve that it can offer the <em>escape</em> from it. But the belief in guilt\n<em>must</em> lead to the belief in hell, <em>and</em> <em>always does</em>. The only way in\nwhich the ego allows the fear of hell to be experienced is to bring hell\n<em>here</em>, but always as a foretaste of the future. For no one who\nconsiders himself as deserving hell can believe that punishment will end\nin peace.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> The Holy Spirit teaches thus: There <em>is</em> no hell. Hell is only what\nthe ego has made of the <em>present.</em> The belief in hell is what prevents\nyou from <em>understanding</em> the present, because you are <em>afraid</em> of it.\nThe Holy Spirit leads as steadily to Heaven as the ego drives to hell.\nFor the Holy Spirit, Who knows <em>only</em> the present, uses it to undo the\nfear by which the ego would make the present useless. There is <em>no</em>\nescape from fear in the ego’s use of time. For time, according to its\nteaching, is nothing but a teaching device for <em>compounding</em> guilt until\nit becomes all-encompassing and demands vengeance forever.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> The Holy Spirit would undo all of this <em>now</em>. Fear is <em>not</em> of the\npresent but only of the past and future, which do not exist. There is no\nfear in the present when each instant stands clear and separated from\nthe past, without its shadow reaching out into the future. Each instant\nis a clean, untarnished birth, in which the Son of God emerges from the\npast into the present. And the present extends forever. It is so\nbeautiful and so clean and free of guilt that nothing but happiness is\nthere. No darkness is remembered, and immortality and joy are <em>now</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> This lesson takes <em>no</em> time. For what is time without a past and\nfuture? It <em>has</em> taken time to misguide you so completely, but it takes\nno time at all to be what you <em>are.</em> Begin to practice the Holy Spirit’s\nuse of time as a teaching aid to happiness and peace. Take this very\ninstant, <em>now</em>, and think of it as <em>all there is</em> of time. Nothing can\nreach you here out of the past, and it is here that you are <em>completely</em>\nabsolved, <em>completely</em> free, and <em>wholly</em> without condemnation. From\nthis holy instant wherein holiness was born again, you will go forth in\ntime without fear and with no sense of change <em>with</em> time.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> Time is inconceivable without change, yet holiness does not change.\nLearn from this instant more than merely hell does not exist. In this\nredeeming instant lies Heaven. And Heaven will not change, for the birth\ninto the holy present is <em>salvation</em> from change. Change is an illusion,\ntaught by those who could not see themselves as guiltless. There is no\nchange in Heaven because there is no change in God. In the holy instant\nin which you see yourself as bright with freedom, you <em>will</em> remember\nGod. For remembering Him <em>is</em> to remember freedom.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> Whenever you are tempted to be dispirited by the thought of how long\nit would take to change your mind so completely, ask yourself, “How long\nis an instant?” Could you not give so short a time to the Holy Spirit\nfor your salvation? He asks no more, for He has no need of more. It\ntakes far longer to teach you how to be willing to give Him this than\nfor Him to use this tiny instant to offer you the whole of Heaven. In\nexchange for this instant, He stands ready to give you the remembrance\nof eternity.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> You will never give this holy instant to the Holy Spirit on behalf of\nyour release while you are unwilling to give it to your brothers on\nbehalf of <em>theirs.</em> For the instant of holiness is shared, and cannot be\nyours alone. Remember, then, when you are tempted to attack a brother,\nthat his instant of release is <em>yours</em>. Miracles are the instants of\nrelease you offer and will <em>receive</em>. They attest to your willingness to\n<em>be</em> released and to offer time to the Holy Spirit for His use of it.\nHow long is an instant? It is as short for your brother as it is for\nyou. Practice giving this blessed instant of freedom to all who are\nenslaved by time and thus make time their friend <em>for</em> them. The Holy\nSpirit gives their blessed instant to <em>you</em> through your giving it. As\nyou give it, He offers it to <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> Be not unwilling to give what you would receive of Him, for you join\nwith Him in giving. In the crystal cleanness of the release you give is\nyour <em>instantaneous</em> escape from guilt. You <em>must</em> be holy if you offer\nholiness. How long is an instant? As long as it takes to reestablish\nperfect sanity, perfect peace, and perfect love for everyone, for God,\nand for <em>yourself</em>. As long as it takes to remember immortality and your\nimmortal creations who share it with you. As long as it takes to\nexchange hell for Heaven. Long enough to transcend all of the ego’s\nmaking and ascend unto your Father.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> Time is your friend if you leave it to the Holy Spirit to use. He\nneeds but very little to restore God’s whole power to you. He Who\ntranscends time for you understands what time is <em>for</em>. Holiness lies\nnot in time but in eternity. There never was an instant in which God’s\nSon could lose his purity. His changeless state is beyond time, for his\npurity remains forever beyond attack and without variability. Time\nstands still in his holiness and changes not. And so it is no longer\ntime at all. For, caught in the single instant of the eternal sanctity\nof God’s creation, it is transformed into forever. <em>Give</em> the eternal\ninstant that eternity may be remembered <em>for</em> you in that shining\ninstant of perfect release. Offer the miracle of the holy instant\nthrough the Holy Spirit and leave His giving it to you to Him.</p>\n\n",

In the holy instant, you will unchain <em>all</em> your brothers\nand refuse to support either <em>their</em> weakness or your <em>own</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> You do not realize how much you have misused your brothers by seeing\nthem as sources of ego support. As a result, they witness <em>to</em> the ego\nin your perception and <em>seem</em> to provide reasons for not letting it go.\nYet they are far stronger and much more compelling witnesses for the\nHoly Spirit. And they support His <em>strength</em>. It is, therefore, your\nchoice whether they support the ego or the Holy Spirit in <em>you</em>. And you\nwill know which you have chosen by <em>their</em> reactions. A Son of God who\nhas been released through the Holy Spirit in a brother, if the release\nis <em>complete</em>, is <em>always</em> recognized. He cannot <em>be</em> denied. As long as\nyou remain uncertain, it can be only because you have not given complete\nrelease. And because of this, you have not given one single instant\n<em>completely</em> to the Holy Spirit. For when you have, you will be <em>sure</em>\nyou have. You will be <em>sure</em> because the witness to Him will speak so\nclearly of Him that you will hear and <em>understand</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> You will doubt until you hear <em>one</em> witness whom you have wholly\nreleased through the Holy Spirit. And then you will doubt no more. The\nholy instant has not yet happened to you. Yet it will, and you will\nrecognize it with perfect certainty. No gift of God is recognized in any\nother way. You can practice the mechanics of the holy instant and will\nlearn much from doing so. Yet its shining and glittering brilliance,\nwhich will literally blind you to this world by its own vision, you\ncannot supply. And here it is, <em>all</em> in this instant, complete,\naccomplished, and given <em>wholly.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> Start now to practice your little part in separating out the holy\ninstant. You will receive very specific instructions as you go along. To\nlearn to separate out this single second and begin to experience it as\ntimeless, is to begin to experience yourself as <em>not</em> separate. Fear not\nthat you will not be given help in this. God’s Teacher and His lesson\nwill support your strength. It is only your weakness that will depart\nfrom you in this practice, for it is the practice of the power of God in\nyou. Use it but for one instant, and you will never deny it again. Who\ncan deny the Presence of what the universe bows to in appreciation and\ngladness? Before the recognition of the universe which witnesses to It,\nyour doubts <em>must</em> disappear.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>22</sup> Be not content with littleness, but be sure you understand what\nlittleness is and why you could never <em>be</em> content with it. Littleness\nis the offering you gave <em>yourself</em>. You offered this in place of\nmagnitude, and you <em>accepted</em> it. Everything in this world is little\nbecause it is a world made out of littleness in the strange belief that\nlittleness can content you. When you strive for anything in this world\nwith the belief that it will bring you peace, you are belittling\nyourself and blinding yourself to glory. Littleness and glory are the\nchoices open to your striving and your vigilance. You will always choose\none at the <em>expense</em> of the other.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> Yet what you do not realize each time you choose is that your choice\nis your evaluation of <em>yourself</em>. Choose littleness and you will not\nhave peace, for you will have judged yourself unworthy of it. And\nwhatever you offer as a substitute is much too poor a gift to satisfy\nyou. It is essential that you accept the fact, and accept it gladly,\nthat there is no form of littleness that can <em>ever</em> content you. You are\nfree to try as many as you wish, but all you will be doing is to delay\nyour homecoming. For you will be content only in magnitude, which is\nyour home.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> There is a deep responsibility you owe yourself, and one which you\nmust learn to remember all the time. The lesson will seem hard at first,\nbut you will learn to love it when you realize that it is true and\nconstitutes a tribute to your power. You who have sought and found\nlittleness, remember this: Every decision which you make stems from what\nyou think you <em>are</em> and represents the value that you <em>put</em> upon\nyourself. Believe the little can content you, and by limiting yourself,\nyou will not be satisfied. For your function is <em>not</em> little, and it is\nonly by finding your function and fulfilling it that you can escape from\nlittleness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> There is no doubt about what your function is, for the Holy Spirit\n<em>knows</em> what it is. There is no doubt about its magnitude, for it\nreaches you through Him <em>from</em> Magnitude. You do not have to strive for\nit because you <em>have</em> it. All your striving must be directed <em>against</em>\nlittleness, for it <em>does</em> require vigilance to protect your magnitude in\nthis world. To hold your magnitude in perfect awareness in a world of\nlittleness is a task the little cannot undertake. Yet it is asked of you\nin tribute to your magnitude and <em>not</em> your littleness. Nor is it asked\nof you alone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> The power of God will support every effort you make on behalf of His\ndear Son. Search for the little, and you deny yourself His power. God is\nnot willing that His Son be content with less than everything. For He is\nnot content without His Son, and His Son cannot be content with less\nthan his Father has given him. We asked you once before, “Would you be\nhostage to the ego or host to God?” Let this question be asked you by\nthe Holy Spirit in you every time you make a decision. For every\ndecision you make <em>does</em> answer this and invites sorrow or joy\naccordingly.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> When God gave Himself to you in your creation, He established you as\nhost to Him forever. He has not left you, and you have not left Him. All\nyour attempts to deny His magnitude and make His Son hostage to the ego\ncannot make little whom God has joined with Him. Every decision you make\nis for Heaven or for hell and will bring you awareness of what you\ndecided <em>for</em>. The Holy Spirit can hold your magnitude, clean of all\nlittleness, clearly and in perfect safety in your minds, untouched by\nevery little gift the world of littleness would offer you. But for this,\nyou cannot side <em>against</em> Him in what He wills for you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> Decide for God through Him. For littleness and the belief that you\ncan be content with littleness are the decisions you have made about\nyourself. The power and the glory that lie in you from God are for all\nwho, like you, perceive themselves as little and have deceived\nthemselves into believing that littleness can be blown up by them into a\nsense of magnitude that can content them. Neither give littleness, nor\naccept it. All honor is due the host of God. Your littleness deceives\nyou, but your magnitude is of Him Who dwells in you and in Whom you\ndwell. Touch no one, then, with littleness, in the name of Christ,\neternal Host unto His Father.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> In this season (Christmas), which celebrates the birth of holiness\ninto this world, join with me, who decided for holiness for <em>you.</em> It is\nour task <em>together</em> to restore the awareness of magnitude to the host\nwhom God appointed for Himself. It is beyond all your littleness to give\nthe gift of God, but <em>not</em> beyond <em>you</em>. For God would give Himself\n<em>through</em> you. He reaches from you to everyone and beyond everyone to\nHis Son’s creations, but without leaving you. Far beyond your little\nworld but still in you, He extends forever. Yet He brings all his\nextensions to you as host to Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> Is it a sacrifice to leave littleness behind and wander not in vain?\nIt is not sacrifice to wake to glory. But it <em>is</em> a sacrifice to accept\nanything <em>less</em> than glory. Learn that you <em>must</em> be worthy of the\nPrince of Peace, born in you in honor of Him Whose host you are. You\nknow not what love means because you have sought to purchase it with\nlittle gifts, thus valuing it too little to be able to understand its\nmagnitude. Love is <em>not</em> little, and love dwells in you, for you are\nhost to Him. Before the greatness that lives in you, your poor\nappreciation of yourself and all the little offerings you have given\nslip into nothingness. Holy Child of God, when will you learn that\n<em>only</em> holiness can content you and give you peace?</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> Remember that you learn not for yourself alone, no more than I did.\nIt is <em>because</em> I learned for you that you can learn of me. I would but\nteach you what is yours, so that together we can replace the shabby\nlittleness that binds the host of God to guilt and weakness with the\nglad awareness of the glory that is in him. My birth in you is your\nawakening to grandeur. Welcome me not into a manger but into the altar\nto holiness, where holiness abides in perfect peace. My Kingdom is not\nof this world because it is in <em>you.</em> And you are of your Father. Let us\njoin in honoring you, who must remain forever beyond littleness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> Decide with me, who have decided to abide with you. I will as my\nFather wills, knowing His Will is constant and at peace forever with\nItself. You will be content with nothing <em>but</em> His Will. Accept no less,\nremembering that everything I learned is yours. What my Father loves, I\nlove as He does, and I can no more accept it as what it is not than He\ncan. And no more can <em>you</em>. When you have learned to accept what you\nare, you will make no more gifts to offer to yourselves, for you will\nknow you are complete, in need of nothing, and unable to accept\n<em>anything</em> for yourself. But you will gladly give, <em>having</em> received.\nThe host of God need not seek to find anything.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> If you are wholly willing to leave salvation to the plan of God and\nunwilling to attempt to grasp for peace yourself, salvation will be\n<em>given</em> you. Yet think not you can substitute your plan for His. Rather,\njoin with me in His that we may release all those who would be bound,\nproclaiming together that the Son of God is host to Him. Thus will we\nlet no one forget what <em>you</em> would remember. And thus will you remember\nit.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> Call forth in everyone only the remembrance of God and of the Heaven\nthat is in him. For where you would help your brother be, there will you\nthink <em>you</em> are. Hear not his call for hell and littleness, but only his\ncall for Heaven and greatness. Forget not that his call is yours, and\nanswer him with me. God’s power is forever on the side of His host, for\nit protects only the peace in which He dwells. Lay not littleness before\nHis holy altar, which rises above the stars and reaches even to Heaven\nbecause of what is given it.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>35</sup> This course is not beyond <em>immediate</em> learning unless you prefer to\nbelieve that what God wills takes time. And this means only that you\nwould <em>rather</em> delay the recognition that His Will is so. The holy\ninstant is <em>this</em> one and <em>every</em> one. The one you <em>want</em> it to be it\n<em>is</em>. The one you would not have it be is lost to you. <em>You</em> must decide\non when it is. Delay it not. For beyond the past and future, in which\nyou will not find it, it stands in shimmering readiness for your\nacceptance. Yet you cannot bring it into glad awareness while you do not\nwant it, for it holds the whole release from littleness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> Your practice must therefore rest upon your willingness to let all\nlittleness go. The instant in which magnitude will dawn upon you is but\nas far away as your <em>desire</em> for it. As long as you desire it not and\ncherish littleness instead, by so much is it far from you. By so much as\nyou want it will you bring it nearer. Think not that you can find\nsalvation in your own way and <em>have</em> it. Give over <em>every</em> plan that you\nhave made for your salvation in exchange for God’s. His will content\nyou, and there is nothing else that can bring you peace. For peace is of\nGod and of no one beside Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> Be humble before Him and yet great <em>in</em> Him. And value no plan of the\nego before the plan of God. For you leave empty your place in His plan,\nwhich you must fulfill if you would join with me, by your decision to\njoin in any plan <em>but</em> His. I call you to fulfill your holy part in the\nplan that He has given to the world for its release from littleness. God\nwould have His host abide in perfect freedom. Every allegiance to a plan\nof salvation that is apart from Him diminishes the value of His Will for\nyou in your own minds. And yet it is your mind that <em>is</em> the host to\nHim.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> Would you learn how perfect and immaculate is the holy altar on which\nyour Father has placed Himself? This you will recognize in the holy\ninstant in which you willingly and gladly give over every plan but His.\nFor there lies peace, perfectly clear because you have been willing to\nmeet its conditions. You can claim the holy instant any time and\nanywhere you want it. In your practice, try to give over every plan you\nhave accepted for finding magnitude in littleness. <em>It is not there</em>.\nUse the holy instant only to recognize that you alone <em>cannot</em> know\nwhere it is and can only deceive yourself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> I stand within the holy instant, as clear as you would have me. And\nthe extent to which you learn to be willing to accept me is the measure\nof the time in which the holy instant will be yours. I call to you to\nmake the holy instant yours at once, for the release from littleness in\nthe mind of the host of God depends on willingness and <em>not</em> on time.\nThe reason why this course is simple is that <em>truth</em> is simple.\nComplexity is of the ego and is nothing more than the ego’s attempt to\nobscure the obvious.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> You could live forever in the holy instant, <em>beginning now</em> and\nreaching to eternity, but for a very simple reason. Do not obscure the\nsimplicity of this reason, for if you do, it will be only because you\nprefer not to recognize it and not to let it go. The simple reason,\nsimply stated, is this: The holy instant is a time in which you receive\nand <em>give</em> perfect communication. This means, however, that it is a time\nin which your mind is <em>open</em>, both to receive and give. It is the\nrecognition that all minds <em>are</em> in communication. It therefore seeks to\n<em>change</em> nothing, but merely to <em>accept</em> everything.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> How can you do this when you would prefer to have <em>private</em> thoughts\nand <em>keep</em> them? The only way you could do <em>that</em> is to <em>deny</em> the\nperfect communication that makes the holy instant what it is. You\nbelieve that it is possible to harbor thoughts you would not share and\nthat salvation lies in keeping your thoughts to yourself <em>alone.</em> For in\nprivate thoughts, known only to yourself, you think you find a way to\nkeep what you would <em>have</em> alone and share what <em>you</em> would share. And\nthen you wonder why it is that you are not in full communication with\nthose around you and with God Who surrounds <em>all</em> of you together.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> Every thought you would keep hidden shuts communication off because\nyou would <em>have</em> it so. It is impossible to recognize perfect\ncommunication while <em>breaking</em> communication holds value to you. Ask\nyourselves honestly, “Would I <em>want</em> to have perfect communication, and\nam I wholly willing to let everything that interferes with it go\nforever?” If the answer is no, then the Holy Spirit’s readiness to give\nit to you is not enough to make it yours, for you are not ready to\n<em>share</em> it with Him. And it cannot come into a mind that has decided to\noppose it. For the holy instant is given and received with <em>equal</em>\nwillingness, being the acceptance of the single will that governs <em>all</em>\nthought.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> The necessary condition for the holy instant does <em>not</em> require that\nyou have no thoughts which are not pure. But it <em>does</em> require that you\nhave none that you would <em>keep</em>. Innocence is not of your making. It is\ngiven you the instant you would <em>have</em> it. Yet it would not be Atonement\nif there were no <em>need</em> for Atonement. You will not be able to accept\nperfect communication as long as you would <em>hide</em> it from yourself. For\nwhat you would hide <em>is</em> hidden from you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> In your practice, then, try only to be vigilant against deception and\nseek not to protect the thoughts you would keep unto yourself. Let the\nHoly Spirit’s purity shine them away and bring all your awareness to the\nreadiness for purity He offers you. Thus will He make you ready to\nacknowledge that you <em>are</em> host to God and hostage to no one and\nnothing.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>45</sup> The holy instant is the Holy Spirit’s most useful learning device for\nteaching you love’s meaning. For its purpose is to suspend judgment\n<em>entirely.</em> Judgment always rests on the past, for past experience is\nthe basis on which you judge. Judgment becomes impossible without the\npast, for without it you do not understand anything. You would make no\nattempt to judge because it would be quite apparent to you that you do\nnot know what anything <em>means.</em> You are afraid of this because you\nbelieve that <em>without</em> the ego all would be chaos. Yet I assure you that\nwithout the ego all would be <em>love</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> The past is the <em>ego’s</em> chief learning device, for it is in the past\nthat you learned to define your own needs and acquired methods for\nmeeting them on your own terms. We said before that to limit love to\n<em>part</em> of the Sonship is to bring guilt into your relationships and thus\nmake them unreal. If you seek to separate out certain aspects of the\ntotality and look to them to meet your imagined needs, you are\nattempting to use separation to <em>save</em> you. How, then, could guilt <em>not</em>\nenter? For separation <em>is</em> the source of guilt, and to appeal to it for\nsalvation is to believe you are alone. To be alone <em>is</em> to be guilty.\nFor to experience yourself as alone is to deny the oneness of the Father\nand his Son and thus to attack reality.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> You cannot love parts of reality and understand what love means. If\nyou would love unlike to God, Who <em>knows</em> no special love, how <em>can</em> you\nunderstand it? To believe that <em>special</em> relationships, with <em>special</em>\nlove, can offer you salvation is the belief that separation <em>is</em>\nsalvation. For it is the complete <em>equality</em> of the Atonement in which\nsalvation lies. How can you decide that special aspects of the Sonship\ncan give you more than others? The <em>past</em> has taught you this. Yet the\nholy instant teaches you it <em>is</em> not so.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> Because of guilt, <em>all</em> special relationships have some elements of\nfear in them. And this is why they shift and change so frequently. They\nare not based on changeless love alone. And love where fear has entered\ncannot be depended on because it is not perfect. In His function as\nInterpreter of what you have made, the Holy Spirit <em>uses</em> special\nrelationships, which <em>you</em> have chosen to support the ego, as a learning\nexperience which points to truth. Under His teaching, <em>every</em>\nrelationship becomes a lesson in love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> The Holy Spirit knows no one is special. Yet He also perceives that\nyou have <em>made</em> special relationships, which He would purify and not let\nyou destroy. However unholy the reason why you made them may be, He can\ntranslate them into holiness by removing as much fear as you will let\nHim. You can place any relationship under His care and be sure that it\nwill not result in pain if you offer Him your willingness to have it\nserve no need but His. All the guilt in it arises from <em>your</em> use of it.\nAll the love from His. Do not, then, be afraid to let go your imagined\nneeds, which would destroy the relationship. Your <em>only</em> need is His.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> Any relationship which you would substitute for another has not been\noffered to the Holy Spirit for His use. There <em>is</em> no substitute for\nlove. If you would attempt to substitute one aspect of love for another,\nyou have placed <em>less</em> value on one and <em>more</em> on the other. You have\nnot only <em>separated</em> them, but you have also judged against <em>both</em>. Yet\nyou had judged against yourself first, or you would never have imagined\nthat you needed them as they were not. Unless you had seen yourself as\n<em>without</em> love, you could not have judged them so like you in lack.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> The ego’s use of relationships is so fragmented that it frequently\ngoes even further—one part of one aspect suits its purposes, while it\nprefers different parts of another aspect. Thus does it assemble reality\nto its own capricious liking, offering for your seeking a picture whose\nlikeness does not exist. For there is nothing in Heaven or earth that it\nresembles, and so however much you seek for its reality, you cannot find\nit because it is not real.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> Everyone on earth has formed special relationships, and although this\nis not so in Heaven, the Holy Spirit knows how to bring a touch of\nHeaven to them here. In the holy instant no one is special, for your\npersonal needs intrude on no one to make them different. Without the\nvalues from the past, you <em>would</em> see them all the same and like\n<em>yourself</em>. Nor would you see any separation between yourself and them.\nIn the holy instant, you see in each relationship what it <em>will</em> be when\nyou perceive only the present.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> God knows you <em>now</em>. He remembers nothing, having <em>always</em> known you\nexactly as He knows you now. The holy instant parallels His knowing by\nbringing <em>all</em> perception out of the past, thus removing the frame of\nreference you have built by which to judge your brothers. Once this is\ngone, the Holy Spirit substitutes His frame of reference for it. His\nframe of reference is simply God. The Holy Spirit’s timelessness lies\nonly here. For in the holy instant, free of the past, you see that love\nis in you, and you have no need to look <em>without</em> and snatch it guiltily\nfrom where you thought it was.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> <em>All</em> your relationships are blessed in the holy instant because the\nblessing is not limited. In the holy instant, the Sonship gains <em>as\none</em>. And united in your blessing, it <em>becomes</em> one to you. The meaning\nof love is the meaning God gave to it. Give to it any meaning <em>apart</em>\nfrom His, and it is impossible to understand it. Every brother God loves\nas He loves you—neither less nor more. He needs them all equally, and so\ndo <em>you.</em> In time you have been told to offer miracles as Christ directs\nand let the Holy Spirit bring to you those who are seeking you. Yet in\nthe holy instant, you unite directly with God, and <em>all</em> your brothers\njoin in Christ. Those who are joined in Christ are in no way separate.\nFor Christ is the Self the Sonship shares, as God shares His Self with\nChrist.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> Think you that you can judge the Self of God? God has created it\n<em>beyond</em> judgment out of His need to extend His Love. With love in you,\nyou have no need <em>except</em> to extend it. In the holy instant, there is no\nconflict of needs, for there is only <em>one</em>. For the holy instant reaches\nto eternity and to the Mind of God. And it is only there love <em>has</em>\nmeaning, and only there <em>can</em> it be understood.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> It is impossible to use one relationship at the expense of another\nand <em>not</em> suffer guilt. And it is equally impossible to condemn part of\na relationship and find peace <em>within</em> it. Under the Holy Spirit’s\nteaching, <em>all</em> relationships are seen as total commitments, yet they do\nnot conflict with one another in any way. Perfect faith in each one for\nits ability to satisfy you <em>completely</em> arises only from perfect faith\nin <em>yourself</em>. And this you cannot have while guilt remains. And there\n<em>will</em> be guilt as long as you accept the possibility, and <em>cherish</em> it,\nthat you can make a brother what he is not because <em>you</em> would have him\nso.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> You have so little faith in yourself because you are unwilling to\naccept the fact that perfect love is in <em>you</em>. And so you seek without\nfor what you cannot <em>find</em> without. I offer you my perfect faith in you\nin place of all your doubt. But forget not that my faith must be as\nperfect in all your brothers as it is in you, or it would be a limited\ngift to <em>you.</em> In the holy instant, we share our faith in God’s Son\nbecause we recognize together that he is wholly worthy of it, and in our\nappreciation of his worth, we <em>cannot</em> doubt his holiness. And so we\nlove him.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>58</sup> All separation vanishes as holiness is shared. For holiness is power,\nand by sharing it, it <em>gains</em> in strength. If you seek for satisfaction\nin gratifying your needs as <em>you</em> perceive them, you must believe that\nstrength comes from another, and what <em>you</em> gain <em>he loses</em>. Someone\nmust <em>always</em> lose if you perceive yourself as weak. Yet there is\nanother interpretation of relationships which transcends the concept of\nloss of power completely.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> You do not find it difficult to believe that, when another calls on\nGod for love, <em>your</em> call remains as strong. Nor do you think that, by\nGod’s answer to him, <em>your</em> hope of answer is diminished. On the\ncontrary, you are far more inclined to regard his success as witness to\nthe possibility of <em>yours</em>. That is because you recognize, however\ndimly, that God is an <em>idea</em>, and so your faith in Him is <em>strengthened</em>\nby sharing. What you find difficult to accept is the fact that, like\nyour Father, <em>you</em> are an idea. And like Him, you can give yourself\ncompletely, <em>wholly</em> without loss, and <em>only</em> with gain.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> Herein lies peace, for here there <em>is</em> no conflict. In the world of\nscarcity, love has no meaning, and peace is impossible. For gain and\nloss are <em>both</em> accepted, and so no one is aware that perfect love is in\nhim. In the holy instant, you recognize the <em>idea</em> of love in you and\nunite this idea with the mind that thought it and could not <em>relinquish</em>\nit. By holding it within itself, there <em>was</em> no loss. The holy instant\nthus becomes a lesson in how to hold all of your brothers in your mind,\nexperiencing not loss, but <em>completion</em>. From this it follows you can\n<em>only</em> give. And this <em>is</em> love, for this alone is natural under the\nlaws of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> In the holy instant, the laws of God prevail, and only they have\nmeaning. The laws of this world cease to hold any meaning at all. When\nthe Son of God accepts the laws of God as what he gladly wills, it is\nimpossible that he be bound or limited in any way. In this instant, he\nis as free as God would have him be. For the instant he <em>refuses</em> to be\nbound, he is <em>not</em> bound.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> In the holy instant, nothing happens that has not always been. Only\nthe veil that has been drawn <em>across</em> reality is lifted. Nothing has\nchanged. Yet the <em>awareness</em> of changelessness comes swiftly as the veil\nof time is pushed aside. No one who has not yet experienced the lifting\nof the veil and felt himself drawn irresistibly into the light behind it\ncan have faith in love <em>without</em> fear. Yet the Holy Spirit <em>gives</em> you\nthis faith because He offered it to me and I <em>accepted</em> it. Fear not the\nholy instant will be denied you, for I denied it not. And through me the\nHoly Spirit gave it unto you, as <em>you</em> will give it. Let no need that\nyou perceive obscure your need of this. For in the holy instant, you\nwill recognize the only need the aspects of the Son of God share\nequally, and by this recognition you will join with me in <em>offering</em>\nwhat is needed.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> It is through <em>us</em> that peace will come. Join me in the <em>idea</em> of\npeace, for in ideas minds <em>can</em> communicate. If you would give\n<em>yourself</em> as your Father gives His Self, you will learn to understand\nSelfhood. And therein is love’s meaning understood. But remember that\nunderstanding is of the <em>mind</em> and <em>only</em> of the mind. Knowledge is\ntherefore of the mind, and its conditions are in the mind with it. If\nyou were not only an idea and <em>nothing else</em>, you could not be in full\ncommunication with all that ever was. Yet as long as you <em>prefer</em> to be\nsomething else, or would attempt to be nothing else and something else\n<em>together</em>, the language of communication, which you know perfectly, you\nwill not remember.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> In the holy instant God is remembered, and the language of\ncommunication with all your brothers is remembered with Him. For\ncommunication is remembered <em>together</em>, as is truth. There is no\nexclusion in the holy instant because the past is gone and with it goes\nthe whole <em>basis</em> for exclusion. Without its source, exclusion vanishes.\nAnd this permits <em>your</em> Source and that of all your brothers to replace\nit in your awareness. God and the power of God will take their rightful\nplace in you, and you will experience the full communication of ideas\nwith ideas. Through your ability to do this, you will learn what you\n<em>must</em> be, for you will begin to understand what your Creator is and\nwhat His creation is along with Him.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>65</sup> Beyond the poor attraction of the special love relationship and\n<em>always</em> obscured by it is the powerful attraction of the Father for His\nSon. There is no other love that can satisfy you, because there <em>is</em> no\nother love. This is the <em>only</em> love that is fully given and fully\nreturned. Being complete, it asks nothing. Being wholly pure, everyone\njoined in it <em>has</em> everything. This is not the basis for <em>any</em>\nrelationship in which the ego enters. For every relationship on which\nthe ego embarks <em>is</em> special. The ego establishes relationships only to\n<em>get</em> something. And it would keep the giver bound to itself through\nguilt.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> It is impossible for the ego to enter into any relationship without\nanger, for the ego believes that anger makes <em>friends.</em> This is not its\nstatement, but it <em>is</em> its purpose. For the ego really <em>believes</em> that\nit can get and keep <em>by making guilty</em>. This is its <em>one</em> attraction; an\nattraction so weak that it would have no hold at all, except that no one\n<em>recognizes</em> it. For the ego always <em>seems</em> to attract through love and\nhas no attraction at all to anyone who perceives that it attracts\nthrough <em>guilt.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> The sick attraction of guilt must be recognized for what it <em>is</em>. For\nhaving been made real to you, it is essential to look at it clearly, and\nby withdrawing your <em>investment</em> in it, to learn to let it go. No one\nwould choose to let go what he believes has value. Yet the attraction of\nguilt has value to you only because you have <em>not</em> looked at what it is\nand have judged it completely in the dark. As we bring it to light, your\nonly question will be why it was you <em>ever</em> wanted it. You have nothing\nto lose by looking open-eyed at this, for ugliness such as this belongs\nnot in your holy mind. The host of God <em>can</em> have no real investment\nhere.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> We said before that the ego attempts to maintain and increase guilt,\nbut in such a way that you do not recognize what it would do to <em>you</em>.\nFor it is the ego’s fundamental doctrine that what you do to others,\n<em>you have escaped.</em> The ego wishes <em>no one</em> well. Yet its survival\ndepends on your belief that <em>you</em> are exempt from its evil intentions.\nIt counsels, therefore, that if you are host to <em>it</em>, it will enable you\nto direct the anger that it holds outward, thus <em>protecting</em> you. And\nthus it embarks on an endless, unrewarding chain of special\nrelationships, forged out of anger and dedicated to but one insane\nbelief—that the more anger you invest <em>outside</em> yourself, the safer\n<em>you</em> become.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> It is this chain that binds the Son of God to guilt, and it is this\nchain the Holy Spirit would remove from his holy mind. For the chain of\nsavagery belongs not around the chosen host of God, who <em>cannot</em> make\nhimself host to the ego. In the name of his release, and in the name of\nHim Who would release him, let us look more closely at the relationships\nwhich the ego contrives and let the Holy Spirit judge them truly. For it\nis certain that, if you will <em>look</em> at them, you will offer them gladly\nto Him. What <em>He</em> can make of them, you do not know, but you will become\nwilling to find out if you are willing, first, to perceive what <em>you</em>\nhave made of them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> In one way or another, every relationship which the ego makes is\nbased on the idea that by <em>sacrificing</em> itself, it becomes <em>bigger</em>. The\n“sacrifice,” which it regards as purification, is actually the root of\nits bitter resentment. For it would much prefer to attack directly and\navoid delaying what it <em>really</em> wants. Yet the ego acknowledges\n“reality” as it sees it and recognizes that no one could interpret\n<em>direct</em> attack as love. Yet to make guilty <em>is</em> direct attack but does\nnot <em>seem</em> to be. For the guilty <em>expect</em> attack, and having <em>asked</em> for\nit, they are <em>attracted</em> to it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> In these insane relationships, the attraction of what you do not want\nseems to be much stronger than the attraction of what you <em>do.</em> For each\none thinks that he has sacrificed something to the other and <em>hates</em> him\nfor it. Yet this is what he thinks he <em>wants</em>. He is not in love with\nthe other at all. He merely believes he is in love with <em>sacrifice.</em> And\nfor this sacrifice, which he demanded of <em>himself</em>, he demands the\n<em>other</em> accept the guilt and sacrifice himself as well. Forgiveness\nbecomes impossible, for the ego believes that to forgive another is to\n<em>lose</em> him. For it is only by attack <em>without</em> forgiveness that the ego\ncan ensure the guilt which holds all its relationships together.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> Yet they only <em>seem</em> to be together. For relationships, to the ego,\nmean only that <em>bodies</em> are together. It is always physical closeness\nthat the ego demands, and it does not object where the <em>mind</em> goes or\nwhat <em>it</em> thinks, for this seems unimportant. As long as the body is\nthere to receive its sacrifice, it is content. To the ego, the mind is\nprivate, and only the <em>body</em> can be shared. Ideas are basically of no\nconcern, except as they draw the body of another closer or farther. And\nit is in these terms that it evaluates ideas as good or bad. What makes\nanother guilty and <em>holds</em> him through guilt is “good.” What <em>releases</em>\nhim from guilt is “bad,” because he would no longer believe that bodies\ncommunicate, and so he would be “gone.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> Suffering and sacrifice are the gifts with which the ego would\n“bless” all unions. And those who are united at its altar <em>accept</em>\nsuffering and sacrifice as the price of union. In their angry alliances,\nborn of the fear of loneliness and yet dedicated to the <em>continuance</em> of\nloneliness, they seek relief from guilt by increasing it in the <em>other</em>.\nFor they believe that this decreases it in <em>them</em>. The other seems\nalways to be attacking and wounding them, perhaps in little ways,\nperhaps “unconsciously,” yet never without demand of sacrifice. The fury\nof those joined at the ego’s altar far exceeds your awareness of it. For\nwhat the ego <em>really</em> wants, you do not realize.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> Whenever you are angry, you can be sure that you have formed a\nspecial relationship which the ego has “blessed,” for anger <em>is</em> its\nblessing. Anger takes many forms, but it cannot long deceive those who\nwill learn that love brings no guilt at all, and what brings guilt\ncannot be love and <em>must</em> be anger. <em>All</em> anger is nothing more than an\nattempt to make someone feel guilty, and this attempt is the <em>only</em>\nbasis which the ego accepts for special relationships. Guilt is the only\nneed the ego has, and as long as you identify with it, guilt will\n<em>remain</em> attractive to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> Yet remember this—to be with a body is <em>not</em> communication. And if\nyou think it is, you will feel guilty about communication and will be\n<em>afraid</em> to hear the Holy Spirit, recognizing in His voice your <em>own</em>\nneed to communicate. The Holy Spirit <em>cannot</em> teach through fear. And\nhow can He communicate with you while you believe that to communicate is\nto make yourself <em>alone</em>? It is clearly insane to believe that by\ncommunicating you will be abandoned. And yet you <em>do</em> believe it. For\nyou think that your minds must be kept private or you will <em>lose</em> them,\nand if your <em>bodies</em> are together your minds remain your own. The union\nof bodies thus becomes the way in which you would keep <em>minds</em> apart.\nFor bodies cannot forgive. They can only do as the mind directs.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> The illusion of the autonomy of the body and <em>its</em> ability to\novercome loneliness is but the working of the ego’s plan to establish\nits <em>own</em> autonomy. As long as you believe that to be with a body is\ncompanionship, you will be compelled to attempt to keep your brother in\nhis body, held there by guilt. And you will see <em>safety</em> in guilt and\n<em>danger</em> in communication. For the ego will <em>always</em> teach that\nloneliness is solved by guilt and that communication is the <em>cause</em> of\nloneliness. And despite the evident insanity of this lesson, you have\n<em>learned</em> it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> Forgiveness lies in communication as surely as damnation lies in\nguilt. It is the Holy Spirit’s teaching function to instruct those who\nbelieve that communication is damnation that communication is\n<em>salvation</em>. And He will do so, for the power of God in Him <em>and</em> you is\njoined in <em>real</em> relationship, so holy and so strong that it can\novercome even <em>this</em> without fear. It is through the holy instant that\nwhat seems impossible is <em>accomplished</em>, making it evident that it is\n<em>not</em> impossible. In the holy instant, guilt holds <em>no</em> attraction,\nsince communication has been restored. And guilt, whose <em>only</em> purpose\nis to disrupt communication, has no function here.</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> Here there is no concealment and no private thoughts. The willingness\nto communicate attracts communication <em>to</em> it and overcomes loneliness\ncompletely. There is complete forgiveness here, for there is no desire\nto exclude anyone from your completion in sudden recognition of the\nvalue of his part in it. In the protection of <em>your</em> wholeness, all are\ninvited and made welcome. And you understand that your completion is\nGod’s, Whose only need is to have <em>you</em> be complete. For your completion\nmakes you His in your awareness. And here it is that you experience\nyourself as you were created and as you <em>are</em>.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>79</sup> The holy instant does not replace the need for learning, for the Holy\nSpirit must not leave you as your Teacher until the holy instant has\nextended far beyond time. For a teaching assignment such as His, He must\nuse everything in this world for your release. He must side with every\nsign or token of your willingness to learn of Him what the truth must\nbe. He is swift to utilize whatever you offer Him on behalf of this. His\nconcern and care for you are limitless. In the face of your <em>fear</em> of\nforgiveness, which He perceives as clearly as He knows forgiveness is\n<em>release</em>, He will teach you to remember that forgiveness is not loss\nbut your <em>salvation</em>. And that in <em>complete</em> forgiveness, in which you\nrecognize that there is nothing to forgive, <em>you</em> are absolved\ncompletely.</p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> Hear Him gladly and learn of Him that you have need of no special\nrelationships at all. You but seek in them what you have thrown away.\nAnd through them you will never learn the value of what you have cast\naside but what you still desire with all your hearts. Let us join\ntogether in making the holy instant all that there is by desiring that\nit <em>be</em> all that there is. God’s Son has such great need of your\nwillingness to strive for this that you cannot conceive of need so\ngreat. Behold the only need that God and His Son share and will to meet\ntogether. You are not alone in this. The will of your creations calls to\nyou to share your will with them. Turn, then, in peace from guilt to God\nand them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> Relate only with what will <em>never</em> leave you and what <em>you</em> can never\nleave. The loneliness of God’s Son is the loneliness of his Father.\nRefuse not the awareness of your completion and seek not to restore it\nto yourselves. Fear not to give redemption over to your Redeemer’s love.\nHe will not fail you, for He comes from One Who <em>cannot</em> fail. Accept\n<em>your</em> sense of failure as nothing more than a mistake in who you are.\nFor the holy host of God is beyond failure, and nothing that he wills\ncan <em>be</em> denied. You are forever in a relationship so holy that it calls\nto everyone to escape from loneliness and join you in your love. And\nwhere you are must everyone seek and <em>find</em> you there.</p>\n\n<p><sup>82</sup> Think but an instant on this: God gave the Sonship to you to ensure\nyour perfect creation. This was His gift, for as He withheld Himself not\nfrom you, He withheld not His creation. Nothing that ever was created\nbut is yours. Your relationships are with the universe. And this\nuniverse, being of God, is far beyond the petty sum of all the separate\nbodies <em>you</em> perceive. For all its parts are joined in God through\nChrist, where they become like to their Father. For Christ knows of no\nseparation from His Father, Who is His one relationship, in which He\ngives as His Father gives to Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> The Holy Spirit is God’s attempt to free you of what He does not\nunderstand. And because of the Source of the attempt, it will <em>succeed</em>.\nThe Holy Spirit asks you to respond as God does, for He would teach you\nwhat <em>you</em> do not understand. God would respond to <em>every</em> need,\nwhatever form it takes. And so He has kept this channel open to receive\nHis communication to you and yours to Him. God does not understand your\nproblem in communication, for He does not share it with you. It is only\nyou who believe that it <em>is</em> understandable.</p>\n\n<p><sup>84</sup> The Holy Spirit knows that it is not understandable, and yet He\nunderstands it because you have <em>made</em> it. In Him alone lies the\nawareness of what God cannot know and what you do not understand. It is\nHis holy function to accept them both, and by removing every element of\ndisagreement, to join them into one. He will do this <em>because</em> it is His\nfunction. Leave, then, what seems to you to be impossible to Him Who\nknows it <em>must</em> be possible because it is the Will of God. And let Him\nWhose teaching is <em>only</em> of God teach you the <em>only</em> meaning of\nrelationships. For God created the only relationship which has meaning,\nand that is His relationship with <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>85</sup> As the ego would limit your perception of your brothers to the body,\nso would the Holy Spirit release your vision and let you see the Great\nRays shining from them, so unlimited that they reach to God. It is this\nshift in vision which is accomplished in the holy instant. Yet it is\nneedful for you to learn just what this shift entails, so you will\nbecome willing to make it permanent. Given this willingness, it will not\nleave you, for it <em>is</em> permanent. For once you have accepted it as the\nonly perception you <em>want</em>, it is translated into knowledge by the part\nwhich God Himself plays in the Atonement, for it is the only step in it\nHe understands. Therefore, in this there will be no delay when you are\nready for it. God is ready <em>now</em>, but <em>you</em> are not.</p>\n\n<p><sup>86</sup> Our task is but to continue as fast as possible the necessary process\nof looking straight at all the interference and seeing it <em>exactly</em> as\nit is. For it is impossible to recognize as wholly <em>without</em>\ngratification what you think you <em>want</em>. The body is the symbol of the\nego, as the ego is the symbol of the separation. And both are nothing\nmore than attempts to limit communication and thereby to make it\nimpossible. For communication must be unlimited in order to have\nmeaning, and <em>deprived</em> of meaning, it will not satisfy you completely.\nYet it remains the only means by which you can establish real\nrelationships.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> Real relationships <em>have</em> no limits, having been established by God.\nIn the holy instant, where the Great Rays <em>replace</em> the body in\nawareness, the recognition of relationships without limits is given you.\nBut to see this, it is necessary to give up every use the ego has for\nthe body and to accept the fact that the ego has <em>no</em> purpose you would\nshare with it. For the ego would limit everyone to a body for <em>its</em>\npurposes, and while you think it <em>has</em> a purpose, you will choose to\nutilize the means by which <em>it</em> tries to turn its purpose into\naccomplishment. This will never <em>be</em> accomplished. Yet you have surely\nrecognized that the ego, whose goals are altogether unattainable, will\nstrive for them with all its might and will do so with the strength\nwhich <em>you</em> have given it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> It is impossible to divide your strength between Heaven and hell, God\nand the ego, and release your power unto creation, which is the only\npurpose for which it was given you. Love would <em>always</em> give increase.\nLimits are demanded by the ego, representing its demands to make little\nand ineffectual. Limit your vision of a brother to his body, which you\n<em>will</em> do as long as you would not release him from it, and you have\ndenied his gift to <em>you</em>. His body <em>cannot</em> give it. And seek it not\nthrough <em>yours</em>. Yet your minds are <em>already</em> continuous, and their\nunion need only be accepted, and the loneliness in Heaven is gone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>89</sup> If you would but let the Holy Spirit tell you of the love of God for\nyou and the need your creations have to be with you forever, you would\nexperience the attraction of the eternal. No one can hear Him speak of\nthis and long remain willing to linger here. For it <em>is</em> your will to be\nin Heaven, where you are complete and quiet in such sure and loving\nrelationships that <em>any</em> limit is impossible. Would you not exchange\nyour little relationships for this? For the body <em>is</em> little and\nlimited, and only those whom you would see <em>without</em> the limits the ego\nwould impose on them can offer you the gift of freedom.</p>\n\n<p><sup>90</sup> You have no conception of the limits you have placed on your\nperception and no idea of all the loveliness that you could see. But\nthis you must remember—the attraction of guilt <em>opposes</em> the attraction\nof God. His attraction for you remains unlimited, but because your\npower, being His, is as great as His, you can turn away from love. What\nyou invest in guilt, you withdraw from God. And your sight grows weak\nand dim and limited, for you have attempted to separate the Father from\nthe Son and limit their communication. Seek not Atonement in <em>further</em>\nseparation. And limit not your vision of God’s Son to what <em>interferes</em>\nwith his release and what the Holy Spirit must <em>undo</em> to set him free.\nFor his belief in limits <em>has</em> imprisoned him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>91</sup> When the body ceases to attract you and when you place no value on it\nas a means for getting <em>anything</em>, then there will be no interference in\ncommunication, and your thoughts will be as free as God’s. As you let\nthe Holy Spirit teach you how to use the body <em>only</em> for purposes of\ncommunication and renounce its use for separation and attack which the\nego sees in it, you will learn you have no need of a body at all. In the\nholy instant there <em>are</em> no bodies, and you experience only the\nattraction of God. Accepting it as undivided, you join Him wholly in an\ninstant. [For you would place <em>no</em> limits on your union <em>with</em> Him.]\nThe reality of this relationship becomes the only truth that you could\never <em>want</em>. All truth <em>is</em> here.</p>\n\n",

For in this world, the attraction of guilt <em>does</em>\nstand between them. Neither time nor season means anything in eternity.\nBut here it is the Holy Spirit’s function to use them both, though not\nas the ego uses them. This is the season when you would celebrate my\nbirth into the world. Yet you know not how to do it. Let the Holy Spirit\nteach you, and let me celebrate <em>your</em> birth through Him. The only gift\nI can accept of you is the gift I <em>gave</em> to you. Release <em>me</em> as I will\n<em>your</em> release. The time of Christ we celebrate <em>together</em>, for it has\nno meaning if we are apart.</p>\n\n<p><sup>93</sup> The holy instant is truly the time of Christ. For in this liberating\ninstant, no guilt is laid upon the Son of God, and his unlimited power\nis thus restored to him. What other gift can you offer me, when only\nthis I will to offer <em>you</em>? And to see me is to see me in everyone and\noffer everyone the gift you offer me. I am as incapable of receiving\nsacrifice as God is, and every sacrifice you ask of yourself, you ask of\nme. Learn <em>now</em> that sacrifice of any kind is nothing but a limitation\nimposed on giving. And by this limitation, you have limited acceptance\nof the gift I offer <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>94</sup> We who are one <em>cannot</em> give separately. When you are willing to\naccept <em>our</em> relationship as real, guilt will hold <em>no</em> attraction for\nyou. For in our union, you will accept <em>all</em> of our brothers. The gift\nof union is the only gift that I was born to give. Give it to me, that\n<em>you</em> may have it. The time of Christ is the time appointed for the gift\nof freedom, offered to everyone. And by <em>your</em> acceptance of it, you\nhave <em>offered</em> it to everyone. It <em>is</em> in your power to make this season\nholy, for it is in your power to make the time of Christ be <em>now</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>95</sup> It is possible to do this all at once because there is but <em>one</em>\nshift in perception that is necessary, for you made but <em>one</em> mistake.\nIt seems like many, but it is all the same. For though the ego takes\nmany forms, it is <em>always</em> the same idea. What is not love is <em>always</em>\nfear and nothing else. It is not necessary to follow fear through all\nthe circuitous routes by which it burrows underground and hides in\ndarkness, to emerge in forms quite different from what it is. Yet it\n<em>is</em> necessary to examine each one as long as you would retain the\n<em>principle</em> which governs all of them. When you are willing to regard\nthem not as separate but as different manifestations of the <em>same</em> idea,\nand one you do not <em>want</em>, they go together. The idea is simply this—you\nbelieve that it is possible to be host to the ego or hostage to God.\nThis is the choice you think you have, and the decision which you\nbelieve that you must make.</p>\n\n<p><sup>96</sup> You see no other alternatives, for you cannot accept the fact that\nsacrifice gets <em>nothing</em>. Sacrifice is so essential to your thought\nsystem that salvation <em>apart</em> from sacrifice means nothing to you. Your\nconfusion of sacrifice and love is so profound that you cannot conceive\nof love <em>without</em> sacrifice. And it is this that you must look\nupon—sacrifice is <em>attack</em>, not love. If you would accept but this <em>one</em>\nidea, your fear of love would vanish. Guilt <em>cannot</em> last when the idea\nof sacrifice has been removed. For if there is sacrifice, as you are\nconvinced, someone must pay and someone must get. And the only question\nwhich remains to be decided is <em>how much</em> is the price for getting\n<em>what</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>97</sup> As host to the ego, you believe that you can give <em>all</em> your guilt\naway <em>whatever</em> you think and purchase peace. And the payment does not\nseem to be <em>yours</em>. While it is obvious that the ego <em>does</em> demand\npayment, it never seems to be demanding it of <em>you</em>. For you are\nunwilling to recognize that the ego, which you invited, is treacherous\nonly to those who think they are its host. The ego will never let you\nperceive this, since this recognition would make it homeless. For when\nthis recognition dawns clearly, you will not be deceived by <em>any</em> form\nthe ego takes to protect itself from your sight.</p>\n\n<p><sup>98</sup> Each form will be recognized as but a cover for the one idea that\nhides behind them all—that love demands sacrifice and is therefore\ninseparable from attack and fear. And that guilt is the <em>price</em> of love,\nwhich must be paid <em>by</em> fear. How fearful, then, has God become to you,\nand how great a sacrifice do you believe His love demands! For total\nlove would demand total sacrifice. And so the ego seems to demand less\nof you than God, and of the two is judged as the lesser of two evils,\none to be feared a little, but the other to be destroyed. For you see\nlove as <em>destructive</em>, and your only question is who is to be destroyed,\nyou or another? You seek to answer this question in your special\nrelationships, in which you are both destroyer and destroyed in part,\nbut with the idea of being able to be neither completely. And this you\nthink saves you from God, Whose total love would completely destroy you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>99</sup> You think that everyone <em>outside</em> yourself demands your sacrifice,\nbut you do not see that <em>only</em> you demand sacrifice and <em>only</em> of\nyourself. Yet the demand of sacrifice is so savage and so fearful that\nyou <em>cannot</em> accept it where it is. But the <em>real</em> price of not\naccepting this has been so great that you have given God away rather\nthan look at it. For if God would demand total sacrifice of you, you\nthought it safer to project Him outward and <em>away</em> from you and not be\nhost to Him. To Him you ascribed the ego’s treachery, inviting it to\ntake His place to <em>protect</em> you from Him. And you do not recognize that\nit is what <em>you</em> invited in that would destroy you and <em>does</em> demand\ntotal sacrifice of you. No partial sacrifice will appease this savage\nguest, for it is an invader who but <em>seems</em> to offer kindness, but\nalways to make the sacrifice complete.</p>\n\n<p><sup>100</sup> You will not succeed in being partial hostage to the ego, for it\nkeeps no bargains and would leave you nothing. [Nor can you be partial\n<em>host</em> to it.] You will have to choose between <em>total</em> freedom and\n<em>total</em> bondage, for there are no alternatives but these. You have tried\nmany compromises in the attempt to avoid recognizing the one decision\nwhich must be made. And yet it is the recognition of the decision <em>just\nas it is</em> that makes the decision so easy! Salvation is simple, being of\nGod and therefore very easy to understand. Do not try to project it from\nyou and see it <em>outside</em> yourself. In you are both the question and the\nanswer—the demand for sacrifice and the peace of God.</p>\n\n",

And\nyou need but invite Him in Who is there <em>already</em>, by recognizing that\nHis Host is One, and no thought alien to His Oneness can abide with Him\nthere. Love must be total to give Him welcome, for the Presence of\nHoliness <em>creates</em> the holiness which surrounds it. No fear can touch\nthe host who cradles God in the time of Christ, for the Host is as holy\nas the Perfect Innocence which He protects and Whose power protects Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>103</sup> This Christmas, give the Holy Spirit <em>everything</em> that would hurt\nyou. <em>Let</em> yourself be healed completely that you may join with Him in\nhealing, and let us celebrate our release together by releasing everyone\nwith us. Leave nothing behind, for release is total, and when you have\naccepted it with me, you will <em>give</em> it with me. All pain and sacrifice\nand littleness will disappear in our relationship, which is as innocent\nas our relationship with our Father, and as powerful. Pain will be\nbrought to us and disappear in our presence, and without pain there can\n<em>be</em> no sacrifice. And without sacrifice, there love <em>must</em> be.</p>\n\n<p><sup>104</sup> You who believe that sacrifice <em>is</em> love must learn that sacrifice\nis <em>separation</em> from love. For sacrifice brings guilt as surely as love\nbrings peace. Guilt is the <em>condition</em> of sacrifice, as peace is the\ncondition for the awareness of your relationship with God. Through guilt\nyou exclude your Father and your brothers from yourself. Through peace\nyou invite them back and realize that they are where your invitation\nbids them be. What you excluded from yourself seems fearful, for you\nendowed it with fear and tried to cast it out though it was part of you.\nWho can perceive part of himself as loathsome and live within himself in\npeace? And who can try to resolve the perceived conflict of Heaven and\nhell in him by casting Heaven out and giving it the attributes of hell\nwithout experiencing himself as incomplete and lonely?</p>\n\n<p><sup>105</sup> As long as you perceive the body as your reality, so long will you\nperceive yourself as lonely and deprived. And so long will you also\nperceive yourself as a victim of sacrifice, justified in sacrificing\nothers. For who could thrust Heaven and its Creator aside <em>without</em> a\nsense of sacrifice and loss? And who can suffer sacrifice and loss\nwithout attempting to <em>restore</em> himself? Yet how could you accomplish\nthis yourselves when the basis of your attempts is the belief in the\n<em>reality</em> of the deprivation? For deprivation breeds attack, being the\nbelief that attack <em>is</em> justified. And as long as you would retain the\ndeprivation, attack becomes salvation, and sacrifice becomes love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>106</sup> So is it that in all your seeking for love, you seek for sacrifice\nand <em>find</em> it. Yet you find not love. It is impossible to deny what love\nis and still <em>recognize</em> it. The meaning of love lies in what you have\ncast <em>outside</em> yourself, and it has no meaning at all apart from you. It\nis what you preferred to <em>keep</em> that has no meaning, while all that you\nwould keep <em>away</em> holds all the meaning of the universe and holds the\nuniverse together in its meaning. For unless the universe were joined in\n<em>you</em>, it would be apart from God, and to be without Him <em>is</em> to be\nwithout meaning.</p>\n\n<p><sup>107</sup> In the holy instant, the condition of love is met, for minds are\njoined without the body’s interference, and where there is\ncommunication, there is peace. The Prince of Peace was born to\nreestablish the condition of love by teaching that communication remains\nunbroken, even if the body is destroyed, provided that you see not the\nbody as the <em>necessary</em> means of communication. And if you understand\nthis lesson, you will realize that to sacrifice the body is to sacrifice\n<em>nothing</em>, and communication, which <em>must</em> be of the mind, cannot be\nsacrificed. Where, then, <em>is</em> sacrifice?</p>\n\n<p><sup>108</sup> The lesson I was born to teach and still would teach to all my\nbrothers is that sacrifice is nowhere and love is everywhere. For\ncommunication embraces <em>everything</em>, and in the peace it re-establishes,\nlove comes of itself. Let no despair darken the joy of Christmas, for\nthe time of Christ is meaningless apart from joy. Let us join in\ncelebrating peace by demanding no sacrifice of anyone, for so will you\noffer me the love I offer you. What can be more joyous than to perceive\nwe are deprived of <em>nothing</em>? Such is the message of the time of Christ,\nwhich I give you that <em>you</em> may give it and return it to the Father, Who\ngave it to me. For in the time of Christ, communication is restored, and\nHe joins us in the celebration of His Son’s creation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>109</sup> God offers thanks to the holy host who would receive Him and let Him\nenter and abide where He would be. And by your welcome does He welcome\nyou into Himself, for what is contained in you who welcome Him is\n<em>returned</em> to Him. And we but celebrate His Wholeness as we welcome Him\ninto ourselves. Those who receive the Father are one with Him, being\nhost to Him Who created them. And by allowing Him to enter, the\nremembrance of the Father enters with Him, and with Him they remember\nthe only relationship they ever had and ever <em>want</em> to have.</p>\n\n<p><sup>110</sup> This is the weekend in which a new year will be born from the time\nof Christ. I have perfect faith in you to do all that you would\naccomplish. Nothing will be lacking, and you will make complete and\n<em>not</em> destroy. Say and understand this:</p>\n\n<p><sup>111</sup> <em>I give you to the Holy Spirit as part of myself.<br /> I know that\nyou will be released, unless I want to<br /> use you to imprison\n<strong>myself.</strong><br /> In the name of <strong>my</strong> freedom I will your release,<br />\nBecause I recognize that we will be released <strong>together</strong>.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>112</sup> So will the year begin in joy and freedom. There is much to do, and\nwe have been long delayed. Accept the holy instant as this year is born\nand take your place, so long left unfulfilled, in the Great Awakening.\nMake this year different by making it all the <em>same.</em> And let <em>all</em> your\nrelationships be made holy <em>for</em> you. This is our will. Amen.</p>\n\n",

That is the <em>ego’s</em> interpretation of\nempathy and is always used to form a special relationship in which the\nsuffering is shared. The capacity to empathize is very useful to the\nHoly Spirit, provided you let Him use it in His way. [His way is very\ndifferent.] He does not understand suffering and would have you teach\nit is not <em>understandable</em>. When He relates through you, He does not\nrelate through the ego to another ego. He does not join in pain, knowing\nthat healing pain is not accomplished by delusional attempts to enter\ninto it and lighten it by sharing the delusion.</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> The clearest proof that empathy as the ego uses it is destructive lies\nin the fact that it is applied only to certain types of problems and in\ncertain people. These it selects <em>out</em> and joins <em>with</em>. And it never\njoins except to strengthen <em>itself</em>. [Having identified with what it\n<em>thinks</em> it understands, it sees <em>itself</em> and would <em>increase</em> itself by\nsharing what is <em>like</em> itself.] Make no mistake about this maneuver;\nthe ego always empathizes to <em>weaken</em>, and to weaken is <em>always</em> to\nattack.

You will learn His\ninterpretation of it if you let Him use your capacity for <em>strength</em> and\n<em>not</em> for weakness. He will not desert you, but be sure that <em>you</em>\ndesert not <em>him</em>. Humility is strength in this sense only—to recognize\nand accept the fact that you do <em>not</em> know is to recognize and accept\nthe fact that He <em>does</em> know. You are not sure that He will do His part\nbecause you have never yet done <em>yours</em> completely. You will not know\nhow to respond to what you do not understand. Be tempted not in this,\nand yield not to the ego’s triumphant use of empathy for <em>its</em> glory.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> The triumph of weakness is not what you would offer to a brother. And\nyet you know no triumph <em>but</em> this. This is not knowledge, and the form\nof empathy that would bring this about is so distorted that it would\nimprison what it would release. The unredeemed cannot redeem, yet they\n<em>have</em> a Redeemer. Attempt to teach Him not. <em>You</em> are the learner; He\nthe Teacher. Do not confuse your role with His, for this will never\nbring peace to anyone. Offer your empathy to Him, for it is <em>His</em>\nperception and <em>His</em> strength that you would share. And let Him offer\nyou His strength and His perception to be shared through you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> The meaning of love is lost in any relationship which looks to\nweakness and hopes to find love there. The power of love, which <em>is</em> its\nmeaning, lies in the strength of God, which hovers over it and blesses\nit silently by enveloping it in healing wings. <em>Let</em> this be, and do not\ntry to substitute <em>your</em> “miracle” for this. We once said that if a\nbrother asks a foolish thing of you, to do it. But be certain that this\ndoes not mean to do a foolish thing that would hurt either him <em>or</em> you,\nfor what would hurt one <em>will</em> hurt the other. Foolish requests are\nfoolish for the simple reason that they conflict because they contain an\nelement of specialness. Only the Holy Spirit recognizes foolish needs as\nwell as real ones. And He will teach you how to meet both without losing\neither.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> <em>You</em> will attempt to do this only in secrecy. And you will think\nthat, by meeting the needs of one, you do not jeopardize another because\nyou keep them separate and secret from each other. That is not the way,\nfor it leads not to light and truth. No needs will long be left unmet if\nyou leave them all to Him Whose <em>function</em> is to meet them. That is\n<em>His</em> function and <em>not</em> yours. He will not meet them secretly, for He\nwould share everything you give through Him. And that is <em>why</em> He gives\nit.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> What you give through Him is for the whole Sonship, <em>not</em> for part of\nit. Leave Him His function, for He will fulfill it if you but ask Him to\nenter your relationships and bless them <em>for</em> you.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>10</sup> You still think holiness is difficult because you cannot see how it\ncan be extended to include everyone. And you have learned that it <em>must</em>\ninclude everyone to <em>be</em> holy. Concern yourselves not with the extension\nof holiness, for the nature of miracles you do not understand. Nor do\n<em>you</em> do them. It is their extension, far beyond the limits you\nperceive, that demonstrates you did <em>not</em> do them. Why should you worry\nhow the miracle extends to all the Sonship when you do not understand\nthe miracle itself? One attribute is no more difficult to understand\nthan is the whole. If miracles <em>are</em> at all, their attributes would\n<em>have</em> to be miraculous, being part of them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> There is a tendency to fragment and then to be concerned about the\ntruth of just a little part of the whole. And this is but a way of\navoiding or <em>looking away</em> from the whole to what you think you might be\nbetter able to understand. For this is but another way in which you\nwould still try to keep understanding to <em>yourself</em>. A better and <em>far</em>\nmore helpful way to think of miracles is this: You do not understand\nthem, either in part <em>or</em> whole. Yet you have <em>done</em> them. Therefore,\nyour understanding cannot be necessary. Yet it is still impossible to\naccomplish what you do not understand. And so there must be something in\nyou that <em>does</em> understand.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> To you the miracle <em>cannot</em> seem natural because what you have done\nto hurt your minds has made them so <em>unnatural</em> that they do not\nremember what is natural to them. And when you are <em>told</em> about it, you\ncannot understand it. The recognition of the part as whole and of the\nwhole in every part is <em>perfectly</em> natural. For it is the way God\nthinks, and what is natural to Him <em>is</em> natural to you. Wholly natural\nperception would show you instantly that order of difficulty in miracles\nis quite impossible, for it involves a contradiction of what miracles\nmean. And if you could understand their meaning, their attributes could\nhardly cause you perplexity.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> You <em>have</em> done miracles, but it is quite apparent that you have not\ndone them alone. You have succeeded whenever you have reached another\nmind and <em>joined</em> with it. When two minds join as one and share one idea\nequally, the first link in the awareness of the Sonship as one has been\nmade. When you have made this joining as the Holy Spirit bids you and\nhave offered it to Him to use as He knows how, His natural perception of\nyour gift enables <em>Him</em> to understand it and <em>you</em> to use His\nunderstanding on your behalf. It is impossible to convince you of the\nreality of what has clearly <em>been</em> accomplished through your\nwillingness, as long as you believe that <em>you</em> must understand it or\nelse it is not real.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> You think your lack of understanding is a <em>loss</em> to you, and so you\nare unwilling to believe that what has happened is true. But can you\n<em>really</em> believe that all that has happened, even though you do <em>not</em>\nunderstand it, has <em>not</em> happened? Yet this <em>is</em> your position. You\nwould have perfect faith in the Holy Spirit and in the effects of His\nteaching if you were not afraid to <em>acknowledge</em> what He taught you. For\nthis acknowledgment means that what has happened you do not understand\nbut that you are willing to accept it <em>because</em> it has happened.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> How can faith in reality be yours while you are bent on making it\nunreal? And are you <em>really</em> safer in maintaining the unreality of what\nhas happened than you would be in joyously accepting it for what it is\nand giving thanks for it? Honor the truth that has been given you, and\nbe glad you do not understand it. Miracles are natural to God and to the\nOne Who speaks for Him. For His task is to translate the miracle into\nthe knowledge which it represents and which is lost to you. Let His\nunderstanding of the miracle be enough for you, and do not turn away\nfrom all the witnesses that He has given you to His reality.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> No evidence will convince you of the truth of what you do not want.\nYet your relationship with Him <em>is</em> real and <em>has</em> been demonstrated.\nRegard this not with fear but with rejoicing. The One you called upon\n<em>is</em> with you. Bid Him welcome and honor His witnesses, who bring you\nthe glad tidings He has come. It is true, just as you fear, that to\nacknowledge Him <em>is</em> to deny all that you think you know. But it was\n<em>never</em> true. What gain is there to you in clinging to it and denying\nthe evidence for truth? For you have come too near to truth to renounce\nit now, and you <em>will</em> yield to its compelling attraction. You can delay\nthis now but only a little while. The Host of God has called to you, and\nyou <em>have</em> heard. Never again will you be wholly willing not to listen.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> This is a year of joy in which your listening will increase, and\npeace will grow with its increase. The power of holiness and the\n<em>weakness</em> of attack have <em>both</em> been brought into awareness. And this\nhas been accomplished in minds firmly convinced that holiness is\nweakness and attack is power. Should not this be a sufficient miracle to\nteach you that your Teacher is <em>not</em> of you? But remember also that\nwhenever you have listened to His interpretation, the results have\nbrought you joy. Would you prefer the results of <em>your</em> interpretation,\nconsidering honestly what they have been? God wills you better. Could\nyou not look with greater charity on whom God loves with perfect love?</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> Do not interpret <em>against</em> God’s Love, for you have many witnesses\nwhich speak of it so clearly that only the blind and deaf could fail to\nsee and hear them. This year, determine not to deny what has been given\nyou by God[. Awake and share it], for that is the only reason He has\ncalled to you. His Voice has spoken clearly, and yet you have so little\nfaith in what you heard because you have preferred to place still\ngreater faith in the disaster <em>you</em> have made. Today let us resolve\n<em>together</em> to accept the joyful tidings that disaster is not real and\nthat reality is not disaster.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> Reality is safe and sure and wholly kind to everyone and everything.\nThere is no greater love than to accept this and be glad. For love asks\nonly that you be <em>happy</em> and will give you everything that makes for\nhappiness. You have never given any problem to the Holy Spirit He has\nnot solved for you, nor will you ever do so. You have never tried to\nsolve anything yourself and been successful. Is it not time you brought\nthese facts <em>together</em> and made <em>sense</em> of them?</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> This is the year for the <em>application</em> of the ideas which have been\ngiven you. For the ideas are mighty forces to be used and not held idly\nby. They have already proved their power sufficiently for you to place\nyour faith in them and not in their denial. This year invest in truth,\nand let it work in peace. Have faith in what has faith in <em>you</em>. Think\nwhat you have <em>really</em> seen and heard and <em>recognize</em> it. Can you be\nalone with witnesses like these?</p>\n\n",

If you will consider what you have taught\nand how alien it is to what you thought you knew, you will be compelled\nto recognize that your Teacher came from beyond your thought system and\nso could look upon it fairly and perceive it was untrue. And He must\nhave done so from the basis of a very different thought system and one\nwith <em>nothing</em> in common with yours. For certainly what He has taught,\nand what you have taught through Him, have nothing in common with what\nyou taught before He came. And the results have been to bring peace\nwhere there was pain, and suffering has disappeared, to be replaced by\njoy.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> You have taught freedom, but you have not learned how to be free. We\nonce said, “By their fruits ye shall know them, and they shall know\nthemselves.” For it is certain that you judge yourself according to your\nteaching. The ego’s teaching produces immediate results because its\ndecisions are immediately accepted as <em>your</em> choice. And this acceptance\nmeans that you are willing to judge yourself accordingly. Cause and\neffect are very clear in the ego’s thought system because all your\nlearning has been directed towards <em>establishing</em> the relationship\nbetween them. And would you not have faith in what you have so\ndiligently taught yourself to believe? Yet remember how much care you\nhave exerted in choosing its witnesses and in avoiding those which spoke\nfor the cause of truth and <em>its</em> effects.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> Does not the fact that you have not learned what you have taught show\nyou that you do not perceive the Sonship as one? And does it not also\nshow you that you do not regard <em>yourself</em> as one? For it is impossible\nto teach successfully wholly <em>without</em> conviction, and it is equally\nimpossible that conviction be <em>outside</em> of you. You could never have\ntaught freedom unless you <em>did</em> believe in it. And it must be that what\nyou taught came from <em>yourself</em>. And yet, this Self you clearly do not\n<em>know</em> and do not recognize It even though It functions. What functions\nmust be <em>there</em>. And it is only if you deny what It has <em>done</em> that you\ncould possibly deny Its Presence.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> This is a course in how to know yourself. You <em>have</em> taught what you\nare but have not let what you are teach <em>you</em>. You have been very\ncareful to avoid the obvious and not to see the <em>real</em> cause and effect\nrelationship that is perfectly apparent. Yet within you is <em>everything</em>\nyou taught. What can it be that has <em>not</em> learned it? It must be this\nthat is <em>really</em> outside yourself, not by your own projection, but in\n<em>truth</em>. And it is this that you have taken in that is <em>not</em> you. What\nyou accept into your minds does not <em>really</em> change them. Illusions are\nbut beliefs in what is not there. And the seeming conflict between truth\nand illusion can only be resolved by separating yourself from the\n<em>illusion</em> and <em>not</em> from truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> Your teaching has already done this, for the Holy Spirit is part of\n<em>you</em>. Created by God, He left neither God nor His creation. He is both\nGod <em>and</em> you, as you are God and Him together. For God’s answer to the\nseparation added more to you than you tried to take away. He protected\nboth your creations and you together, keeping one with you what you\nwould exclude. And they will take the place of what you took in to\nreplace them. They are quite real as part of the Self you do not know.\nAnd they communicate to you through the Holy Spirit, and their power and\ngratitude to you for their creation they offer gladly to your teaching\nof yourself, who is their home. You who are host to God are also host to\nthem. For nothing real has ever left the mind of its creator. And what\nis not real was never <em>there</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> You are not two selves in conflict. What is beyond God? If you who\nhold Him and whom He holds <em>are</em> the universe, all else must be\n<em>outside</em>, where <em>nothing</em> is. You have taught this, and from far off in\nthe universe, yet not beyond yourself, the witnesses to your teaching\nhave gathered to help you learn. Their gratitude has joined with yours\nand God’s to strengthen your faith in what you taught. For what you\ntaught is true. Alone you stand outside your teaching and <em>apart</em> from\nit. But <em>with</em> them you must learn that you but taught <em>yourself</em> and\nlearned from the conviction you shared with them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> This year you will begin to learn and make learning commensurate with\nteaching. You have chosen this by your own willingness to teach. Though\nyou seemed to suffer for it, the joy of teaching will yet be yours. For\nthe joy of teaching is in the <em>learner</em>, who offers it to the teacher in\ngratitude and shares it with him. As you learn, your gratitude to your\nSelf, Who teaches you what He is, will grow and help you honor Him. And\nyou will learn His power and strength and purity, and love Him as His\nFather does. His Kingdom has no limits and no end, and there is nothing\nin Him that is not perfect and eternal. All this is <em>you</em>, and nothing\noutside of this <em>is</em> you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> To your most holy Self, all praise is due for what you are and for\nwhat He is Who created you as you are. Sooner or later must everyone\nbridge the gap which he imagines exists between his selves. Each one\nbuilds this bridge which carries him <em>across</em> the gap as soon as he is\nwilling to expend some little effort on behalf of bridging it. His\nlittle efforts are powerfully supplemented by the strength of Heaven and\nby the united will of all who make Heaven what it is, being joined\nwithin it. And so the one who would cross over is literally transported\nthere.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> Your bridge is builded stronger than you think, and your foot is\nplanted firmly on it.

    "content": "<p><sup>30</sup> Be not afraid to look upon the special hate relationship, for freedom\nlies in looking at it. It would be impossible not to know the meaning of\nlove except for this. For the special love relationship, in which the\nmeaning of love is <em>lost</em>, is undertaken solely to offset the hate but\n<em>not</em> to let it go. Your salvation will rise clearly before your open\neyes as you look on this. You cannot <em>limit</em> hate. The special love\nrelationship will not offset it but will merely drive it underground and\nout of sight. It is essential to bring it <em>into</em> sight and to make no\nattempt to hide it. For it is the attempt to balance hate with love that\n<em>makes</em> love meaningless to you. The extent of the split that lies in\nthis you do not realize. And <em>until</em> you do, the split will remain\nunrecognized and therefore unhealed.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> The symbols of hate against the symbols of love play out a conflict\nwhich does not exist. For symbols stand for something <em>else</em>, and the\nsymbol of love is without meaning if love is everything. You will go\nthrough this last undoing quite unharmed and will at last emerge as\nyourself. This is the last step in the readiness for God. Be not\nunwilling now. You are too near, and you will cross the bridge in\nperfect safety, translated quietly from war to peace. For the illusion\nof love will <em>never</em> satisfy, but its reality, which awaits you on the\nother side, will give you everything.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> The special love relationship is an attempt to limit the destructive\neffects of hate by finding a haven in the storm of guilt. It makes no\nattempt to rise <em>above</em> the storm into the sunlight. On the contrary, it\nemphasizes guilt <em>outside</em> the haven by attempting to build barricades\nagainst it and keep within them. The special love relationship is not\nperceived as a value in itself, but as a place of safety from which\nhatred is split off and kept apart. The special love partner is\nacceptable only as long as he serves this purpose. Hatred can enter and\nindeed is welcome in <em>some</em> aspects of the relationship, but it is still\nheld together by the illusion of love. If the illusion goes, the\nrelationship is broken or becomes unsatisfying on the grounds of\ndisillusionment.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> Love is <em>not</em> an illusion. It is a fact. Where disillusionment is\npossible, there was not love but hate. For hate <em>is</em> an illusion, and\nwhat can change was <em>never</em> love. It is certain that those who select\ncertain ones as partners in any aspect of living and use them for any\npurpose which they would not share with others, are trying to <em>live</em>\nwith guilt rather than <em>die</em> of it. This is the choice they see. And\nlove to them is only an escape from death. They seek it desperately but\nnot in the peace in which it would gladly come quietly <em>to</em> them. And\nwhen they find the fear of death is still upon them, the love\nrelationship <em>loses</em> the illusion that it is what it is not. For then\nthe barricades against it are broken, fear rushes in, and hatred\ntriumphs.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> There are no triumphs of love. Only hate is concerned with the\n“triumph of love” at all. The illusion of love <em>can</em> triumph over the\nillusion of hate, but always at the price of making <em>both</em> illusions. As\nlong as the illusion of hatred lasts, so long will love be an illusion\nto you. And then the only choice which remains possible is which\nillusion you prefer. There <em>is</em> no conflict in the choice between truth\nand illusion. Seen in <em>these</em> terms, no one would hesitate. But conflict\nenters the instant the choice seems to be one between <em>illusions</em>, for\nthis choice does not matter. Where one choice is as dangerous as the\nother, the decision <em>must</em> be one of despair.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> Your task is not to seek for love but merely to seek and find <em>all</em>\nof the barriers within yourself which you have built <em>against</em> it. It is\nnot necessary to seek for what is true, but it <em>is</em> necessary to seek\nfor what is false. Every illusion is one of fear, whatever form it\ntakes. And the attempt to escape from one illusion into another <em>must</em>\nfail. If you seek love outside yourself, you can be certain that you\nperceive hatred within and are <em>afraid</em> of it. Yet peace will never come\nfrom the illusion of love, but <em>only</em> from its reality.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> Recognize this, for it is true, and truth <em>must</em> be recognized if it\nis to be distinguished from illusion: The special love relationship is\nan attempt [to bring <em>love into separation</em>. And, as such, it is\nnothing more than an attempt] to bring love into fear and make it\n<em>real</em> in fear. In fundamental violation of love’s condition, the\nspecial love relationship would accomplish the impossible. How but in\nillusion <em>could</em> this be done? It is essential that we look very closely\nat exactly what it is you think you can do to solve the dilemma, which\nseems very real to you, but which does not exist. You have come very\nclose to truth, and only this stands between you and the bridge that\nleads you into it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> Heaven waits silently, and your creations are holding out their hands\nto help you cross and welcome them. For it is <em>they</em> you <em>seek</em>. You\nseek but for your own completion, and it is they who render you\ncomplete. The special love relationship is but a shabby substitute for\nwhat makes you whole in truth, <em>not</em> in illusion. Your relationship with\nthem is without guilt, and this enables you to look on all your brothers\nwith gratitude because your creations were created in union <em>with</em> them.\nAcceptance of your creations is the acceptance of the oneness of\ncreation, without which you could never <em>be</em> complete. No specialness\ncan offer you what God has given and what you are joined with Him in\ngiving.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> Across the bridge is your completion, for you will be wholly in God,\nwilling for nothing special but only to be wholly like unto Him,\ncompleting Him by <em>your</em> completion. Fear not to cross to the abode of\npeace and perfect holiness. Only there is the completion of God and of\nHis Son established forever. Seek not for this in the bleak world of\nillusion, where nothing is certain, and where everything fails to\nsatisfy. In the Name of God, be wholly willing to abandon <em>all</em>\nillusions. In any relationship in which you are wholly willing to accept\ncompletion, and <em>only</em> this, there is God completed and His Son with\nHim.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> The bridge that leads to union in yourself <em>must</em> lead to knowledge,\nfor it was built with God beside you and will lead you straight to Him,\nwhere your completion rests wholly compatible with His. Every illusion\nwhich you accept into your mind by judging it to be attainable removes\nyour own sense of completion and thus denies the wholeness of your\nFather. Every fantasy, be it of love or hate, deprives you of knowledge,\nfor fantasies are the veil behind which truth is hidden. To lift the\nveil which seems so dark and heavy, it is only needful to value truth\nbeyond <em>all</em> fantasy and to be entirely unwilling to settle for illusion\n<em>in place</em> of truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> Would you not go <em>through</em> fear to love? For such the journey seems\nto be. Love calls, but hate would have you stay. Hear not the call of\nhate, and see no fantasies[, for your completion lies in truth and\n<em>nowhere else</em>]. See in the call of hate and in every fantasy that\nrises to delay you but the call for help which rises ceaselessly from\nyou to your Creator. Would He not answer you whose completion is His? He\nloves you wholly without illusion, as you must love. For love <em>is</em>\nwholly without illusion and therefore wholly without fear. Whom God\nremembers <em>must</em> be whole. And God has never forgotten what makes <em>Him</em>\nwhole. In your completion lies the memory of His wholeness and His\ngratitude to you for His completion. In His link with you lie both His\ninability to forget and your ability to remember. In Him are joined your\nwillingness to love and all the love of God, Who forgot you not.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> Your Father can no more forget the truth in you than you can fail to\nremember it. The Holy Spirit is the bridge to Him, made from your\nwillingness to unite with Him and created by His joy in union with you.\nThe journey that seemed to be endless is almost complete, for what <em>is</em>\nendless is very near. You have almost recognized it. Turn with me firmly\naway from all illusions <em>now</em>, and let nothing stand in the way of\ntruth. We will take the last foolish journey <em>away</em> from truth together,\nand then together we go straight to God in joyous answer to His call for\nHis completion.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> If special relationships of any kind would hinder God’s completion,\n<em>can</em> they have value to you? What would interfere with God <em>must</em>\ninterfere with you. Only in time does interference in God’s completion\nseem to be possible. The bridge that He would carry you across lifts you\nfrom time into eternity. Waken from time and answer fearlessly the call\nof Him Who gave eternity to you in your creation. On this side of the\nbridge to timelessness you understand nothing. But as you step lightly\nacross it, upheld <em>by</em> timelessness, you are directed straight to the\nHeart of God. At its center, and <em>only</em> there, you are safe forever\nbecause you are <em>complete</em> forever. There is no veil the love of God in\nus together cannot lift. The way to truth is open. Follow it with me.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>43</sup> In looking at the special relationship, it is necessary first to\nrealize that it involves a great amount of pain. Anxiety, despair,\nguilt, and attack all enter into it, broken into by periods in which\nthey <em>seem</em> to be gone. All these must be understood for what they are.\nWhatever form they take, they are always an attack on the self to make\nthe <em>other</em> guilty. We have spoken of this before, but there are some\naspects of what is really being attempted that we have not touched upon.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> Very simply, the attempt to make guilty is <em>always</em> directed against\nGod. For the ego would have you see Him, and Him <em>alone</em>, as guilty,\nleaving the Sonship open to attack and unprotected from it. The special\nlove relationship is the ego’s chief weapon for keeping you from Heaven.\nIt does not <em>appear</em> to be a weapon, but if you consider <em>how</em> you value\nit and <em>why</em>, you will realize what it must be. The special love\nrelationship is the ego’s most boasted gift, and one which has the most\nappeal to those unwilling to relinquish guilt. The “dynamics” of the ego\nare clearest here, for counting on the attraction of this offering, the\nfantasies which center around it are often quite open. Here they are\nusually judged to be acceptable and even natural. No one considers it\nbizarre to love and hate together, and even those who believe that hate\nis sin merely feel guilty and do not correct it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> This <em>is</em> the “natural” condition of the separation, and those who\nlearn that it is not natural at all seem to be the <em>unnatural</em> ones. For\nthis world <em>is</em> the opposite of Heaven, being <em>made</em> to be its opposite,\nand everything here takes a direction exactly opposite of what is true.\nIn Heaven, where the meaning of love is known, love is the same as\n<em>union</em>. Here, where the illusion of love is accepted in love’s place,\nlove is perceived as separation and <em>exclusion</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> It is in the special relationship, born of the hidden wish for\nspecial love from God, that the ego’s hatred triumphs. For the special\nrelationship is the <em>renunciation</em> of the love of God and the attempt to\nsecure for the self the specialness which He denied. It is essential to\nthe preservation of the ego that you believe this specialness is not\nhell, but Heaven. For the ego would never have you see that separation\ncan <em>only</em> be loss, being the one condition in which Heaven <em>cannot</em> be.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> To everyone Heaven is completion. There can be no disagreement on\nthis, because both the ego and the Holy Spirit accept it. They are,\nhowever, in <em>complete</em> disagreement on what completion <em>is</em> and <em>how</em> it\nis accomplished. The Holy Spirit knows that completion lies first in\nunion and then in the extension of union. To the ego, completion lies in\ntriumph and in the extension of the “victory” even to the final triumph\nover God. In this it sees the ultimate freedom of the self, for nothing\nwould remain to interfere with <em>it</em>. This <em>is</em> its idea of Heaven. From\nthis it follows that union, which is a condition in which the ego\n<em>cannot</em> interfere, <em>must</em> be hell.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> The special relationship is a strange and unnatural ego device for\njoining hell and Heaven and making them indistinguishable. And the\nattempt to find the imagined “best” of both worlds has merely led to\nfantasies of both and to the inability to perceive either one as it is.\nThe special relationship is the triumph of this confusion. It is a kind\nof union from which union is <em>excluded</em>, and the basis for the <em>attempt</em>\nat union rests on exclusion. What better example could there be of the\nego’s maxim, “Seek but do not find?”</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> Most curious of all is the concept of the self which the ego fosters\nin the special relationship. This “self” seeks the relationship to make\nitself complete. Yet when it <em>finds</em> the special relationship in which\nit thinks it can accomplish this, it gives itself <em>away</em> and tries to\n“trade” itself for the self of another. This is not union, for there is\nno increase and no extension. Each partner tries to sacrifice the self\nhe does not want for one he thinks he would prefer. And he feels guilty\nfor the “sin” of taking and of giving nothing of value in return. For\nhow much value <em>can</em> he place upon a self that he would give away to get\na better one?</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> The “better” self the ego seeks is always one that is <em>more</em> special.\nAnd whoever seems to possess a special self is “loved” for what can be\ntaken <em>from</em> him. Where both partners see this special self in each\nother, the ego sees “a union made in Heaven.” For neither one will\nrecognize that he has asked for hell, and so he will not interfere with\nthe ego’s illusion of Heaven, which it offered him to <em>interfere</em> with\nHeaven. Yet if all illusions are of fear, and they <em>can</em> be of nothing\nelse, the illusion of Heaven is nothing more than an “attractive” form\nof fear in which the guilt is buried deep and rises in the form of\n“love.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> The appeal of hell lies only in the terrible attraction of guilt,\nwhich the ego holds out to those who place their faith in littleness.\nThe conviction of littleness lies in <em>every</em> special relationship, for\nonly the deprived could <em>value</em> specialness. The demand for specialness\nand the perception of the giving of specialness as an act of love would\nmake love <em>hateful</em>. And the real purpose of the special relationship,\nin strict accordance with the ego’s goals, is to destroy reality and\nsubstitute illusion. For the ego is <em>itself</em> an illusion, and only\nillusions <em>can</em> be the witnesses to its “reality.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> If you perceived the special relationship as a triumph over God,\nwould you <em>want</em> it? Let us not think of its fearful nature nor of the\nguilt it must entail nor of the sadness and the loneliness. For these\nare only attributes of the whole religion of the separation and of the\ntotal context in which it is thought to occur. The central theme in its\nlitany to sacrifice is that God must die so <em>you</em> can live. And it is\nthis theme which is acted out in the special relationship. Through the\ndeath of <em>your</em> self, you think you can attack another self and snatch\nit from the other to replace the self which you despise. And you despise\nit because you do not think it offers the specialness which you demand.\nAnd <em>hating</em> it, you have made it little and unworthy because you are\n<em>afraid</em> of it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> How can you grant unlimited power to what you think you have\nattacked? So fearful has the truth become to you that <em>unless</em> it is\nweak and little, [and unworthy of value,] you would not dare to look\nupon it. You think it safer to endow the little self which you have made\nwith power you <em>wrested</em> from truth, triumphing over it and leaving it\nhelpless. See how <em>exactly</em> is this ritual enacted in the special\nrelationship. An altar is erected in between two separate people on\nwhich each seeks to kill his self and on his body raise another self\nwhich takes its power from his death. Over and over and over this ritual\nis enacted. And it is <em>never</em> completed nor ever <em>will</em> be completed.\nFor the ritual of completion <em>cannot</em> complete, and life arises not from\ndeath, nor Heaven from hell.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> Whenever any form of special relationship tempts you to seek for love\nin ritual, remember love is <em>content</em> and not form of <em>any</em> kind. The\nspecial relationship is a <em>ritual</em> of form, aimed at the raising of the\nform to take the place of God at the <em>expense</em> of content. There <em>is</em> no\nmeaning in the form, and there will never be. The special relationship\nmust be recognized for what it is—a senseless ritual in which strength\nis extracted from the death of God and invested in His killer as the\nsign that form has triumphed over content and love has lost its meaning.\nWould you <em>want</em> this to be possible, even apart from its evident\nimpossibility? For if it <em>were</em> possible, you would have made <em>yourself</em>\nhelpless. God is not angry. He merely could not let this happen. You\n<em>cannot</em> change His Mind.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> No rituals that you have set up in which the dance of death delights\nyou can bring death to the eternal. Nor can your chosen substitute for\nthe wholeness of God have any influence at all upon it. See in the\nspecial relationship nothing more than a meaningless attempt to raise\nother gods before Him and by worshiping them to obscure <em>their</em> tininess\nand His <em>greatness</em>. In the name of your completion, you do not <em>want</em>\nthis. For every idol which you raise to place before Him stands before\n<em>you</em> in place of what you <em>are</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Salvation lies in the simple fact that illusions are not fearful\nbecause they are not <em>true</em>. They but seem to be fearful to the extent\nto which you fail to recognize them for what they are, and you <em>will</em>\nfail to do this to the extent to which you <em>want</em> them to be true. And\nto the same extent you are <em>denying</em> truth, and so are making yourself\nunable to make the simple choice between truth and illusion, God and\nfantasy. Remember this and you will have no difficulty in perceiving the\ndecision as just what it <em>is</em> and nothing more.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> The core of the separation delusion lies simply in the <em>fantasy</em> of\ndestruction of love’s meaning. And unless love’s meaning is <em>restored</em>\nto you, you cannot know yourself, who <em>shares</em> its meaning. Separation\nis only the decision <em>not</em> to know yourself. Its whole thought system is\na carefully contrived learning experience designed to lead <em>away</em> from\ntruth and into fantasy. Yet for every learning that would hurt you, God\noffers you correction and complete escape from <em>all</em> its consequences.\nThe decision whether or not to listen to this course and follow it is\nbut the choice between truth and illusion. For here is truth <em>separated</em>\nfrom illusion and not confused with it at all.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> How simple does this choice become when it is perceived as only what\nit is. For <em>only</em> fantasies made confusion in choosing possible, and\nthey are totally unreal. This year is thus the time to make the easiest\ndecision that ever confronted you and also the <em>only</em> one. You will\ncross the bridge into reality simply because you will recognize that God\nis on the other side and nothing <em>at all</em> is here. It is impossible\n<em>not</em> to make the natural decision as this is realized.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>59</sup> The search for the special relationship is the sign that you equate\nyourself with the ego and not with God. For the special relationship has\nvalue <em>only</em> to the ego. To the ego <em>unless</em> a relationship has special\nvalue, it has <em>no</em> meaning, and it perceives <em>all</em> love as special. Yet\nthis <em>cannot</em> be natural, for it is unlike the relationship of God and\nHis Son, and all relationships that are unlike this one <em>must</em> be\nunnatural. For God created love as He would have it be and gave it as it\n<em>is</em>. Love has no meaning except as its Creator defined it by His Will.\nIt is impossible to define it otherwise and <em>understand</em> it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> Love is <em>freedom</em>. To look for it by placing yourself in bondage is\nto <em>separate</em> yourself from it. For the love of God, no longer seek for\nunion in separation nor for freedom in bondage! As you release, so will\nyou be released. Forget this not, or love will be unable to find you and\ncomfort you. There is a way in which the Holy Spirit asks your help if\nyou would have His. The holy instant is His most helpful tool in\nprotecting you from the attraction of guilt, the real lure in the\nspecial relationship. You do not recognize that this <em>is</em> its real\nappeal, for the ego has taught you that <em>freedom</em> lies in it. Yet the\ncloser you look at the special relationship, the more apparent it\nbecomes that it <em>must</em> foster guilt and therefore <em>must</em> imprison.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> The special relationship is totally without meaning without a body.\nAnd if you value it, you must <em>also</em> value the body. And what you value,\nyou <em>will</em> keep. The special relationship is a device for limiting\n<em>your</em> self to a body and for limiting your perception of others to\n<em>theirs</em>. The Great Rays would establish the total <em>lack</em> of value of\nthe special relationship if they were seen. For in seeing them, the body\nwould disappear because its <em>value</em> would be lost. And so your whole\ninvestment in seeing it would be withdrawn from it. You see the world\nyou <em>value</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> On this side of the bridge, you see the world of separate bodies\nseeking to join each other in separate unions and to become one by\nlosing. When <em>two</em> individuals seek to become one, they are trying to\n<em>decrease</em> their magnitude. Each would deny his power, for the\n<em>separate</em> union excludes the universe. Far more is left outside than\nwould be taken in. For God is left without and <em>nothing</em> taken in. If\n<em>one</em> such union were made in perfect faith, the universe <em>would</em> enter\ninto it. Yet the special relationship which the ego seeks does not\ninclude even one whole individual. For the ego wants but <em>part</em> of him\nand sees <em>only</em> this part and nothing else.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> Across the bridge, it is so different! For a time the body is still\nseen but not exclusively, as it is seen here. For the little spark which\nholds the Great Rays within it is <em>also</em> visible, and this spark cannot\nbe limited long to littleness. Once you have crossed the bridge, the\nvalue of the body is so diminished in your sight that you will see no\nneed at all to magnify it. For you will realize that the only value\nwhich the body has is to enable you to bring your brothers to the bridge\n<em>with</em> you and to be released <em>together</em> there.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> The bridge itself is nothing more than a transition in your\nperspective of reality. On this side, everything you see is grossly\ndistorted and completely out of perspective. What is little and\ninsignificant is magnified, and what is strong and powerful cut down to\nlittleness. In the transition there is a period of confusion in which a\nsense of actual disorientation seems to occur. But fear it not, for it\nmeans nothing more than that you have been willing to let go your hold\non the distorted frame of reference which seemed to hold your world\ntogether. This frame of reference is built around the special\nrelationship. <em>Without</em> this illusion, there can <em>be</em> no meaning you\nwould still seek here.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality.\nTime is kind, and if you use it <em>for</em> reality, it will keep gentle pace\nwith you in your transition. The urgency is only in dislodging your\nminds from their fixed position here. This will not leave you homeless\nand without a frame of reference. The period of disorientation which\nprecedes the actual transition is far shorter than the time it took to\nfix your minds so firmly on illusions. Delay will hurt you now more than\nbefore only because you realize it <em>is</em> delay and that escape from pain\nis really possible. Find hope and comfort rather than despair in this:\nYou could no longer find even the <em>illusion</em> of love in any special\nrelationship here. For you are no longer wholly insane, and you would\nrecognize the guilt of self-betrayal for what it <em>is</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> Nothing you seek to strengthen in the special relationship is\n<em>really</em> part of you. And you cannot keep part of the thought system\nwhich taught you it was real and understand the Thought that <em>really</em>\nknows what you are. You <em>have</em> allowed the Thought of your reality to\nenter your minds, and because you invited it, it <em>will</em> abide with you.\nYour love for it will not allow you to betray yourself, and you could\nnot enter into a relationship where it could not go with you, for you\nwould not <em>be</em> apart from it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> Be glad you have escaped the mockery of salvation which the ego\noffered you and look not back with longing on the travesty it made of\nyour relationships. Now no one need suffer, for you have come too far to\nyield to the illusion of the beauty and holiness of guilt. Only the\nwholly insane could look on death and suffering, sickness and despair\nand see it thus. What guilt has wrought is ugly, fearful, and very\ndangerous. See no illusion of truth and beauty there. And be you\nthankful that there <em>is</em> a place where truth and beauty wait for you. Go\non to meet them gladly, and learn how much awaits you for the simple\nwillingness to give up nothing <em>because</em> it is nothing.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> The new perspective you will gain from crossing over will be the\nunderstanding of where Heaven <em>is</em>. From here it seems to be outside and\nacross the bridge. Yet as you cross to join it, it will join with <em>you</em>\nand become one with you. And you will think in glad astonishment that\nfor all this you gave up <em>nothing</em>! The joy of Heaven, which has no\nlimit, is increased with each light that returns to take its rightful\nplace within it. Wait no longer, for the love of God and <em>you</em>. And may\nthe holy instant speed you on the way, as it will surely do if you but\nlet it come to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> The Holy Spirit asks only this little help of you. Whenever your\nthoughts wander to a special relationship which still attracts you,\nenter with Him into a holy instant and there let Him release you. He\nneeds only your willingness to <em>share</em> His perspective to give it to you\ncompletely. And your willingness need not be complete because <em>His</em> is\nperfect. It is His task to atone for your unwillingness by His perfect\nfaith, and it is His faith you share with Him there. Out of your\nrecognition of your unwillingness for your release, His <em>perfect</em>\nwillingness is given you. Call upon Him, for Heaven is at His call. And\n<em>let</em> Him call on Heaven <em>for</em> you.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>70</sup> It is impossible to let the past go without relinquishing the special\nrelationship. For the special relationship is an attempt to <em>reenact</em>\nthe past and <em>change</em> it. Imagined slights, remembered pain, past\ndisappointments, perceived injustices, and deprivations all enter into\nthe special relationship, which becomes a way in which you seek to\nrestore your wounded self-esteem. What basis would you have for choosing\na special partner <em>without</em> the past? Every such choice is made because\nof something “evil” in the past to which you cling and for which must\nsomeone else atone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> The special relationship <em>takes vengeance</em> on the past. By seeking to\nremove suffering in the past, it <em>overlooks</em> the present in its\npreoccupation with the past and its total commitment to it. <em>No</em> special\nrelationship is experienced in the present. Shades of the past envelop\nit and make it what it is. It <em>has</em> no meaning in the present, and if it\nmeans nothing <em>now</em>, it cannot have any real meaning at all. How can you\nchange the past <em>except</em> in fantasy? And who can give you what you think\nthe past deprived you of? The past is nothing. Do not seek to lay the\nblame for deprivation on it, for the past is gone. You cannot really\n<em>not</em> let go what has <em>already</em> gone. It must be, therefore, that you\nare maintaining the illusion that it has <em>not</em> gone because you think it\nserves some purpose that you want <em>fulfilled</em>. And it must also be that\nthis purpose could <em>not</em> be fulfilled in the present, but <em>only</em> in the\npast.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> Do not underestimate the intensity of the ego’s drive for vengeance\non the past. It is completely savage and completely insane. For the ego\nremembers everything that you have done which offended it and seeks\nretribution of <em>you</em>. The fantasies it brings to the special\nrelationships it chooses in which to act out its hate are fantasies of\n<em>your</em> destruction. For the ego holds the past <em>against</em> you, and in\nyour <em>escape</em> from the past, it sees itself deprived of the vengeance it\nbelieves that you so justly merit. Yet without your alliance in your own\ndestruction, the ego could not hold you to the past.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> In the special relationship, you are <em>allowing</em> your destruction to\nbe. That this is insane is obvious. But what is less obvious to you is\nthat the <em>present</em> is useless to you while you pursue the ego’s goal as\nits ally. The past is gone; seek not to preserve it in the special\nrelationship, which binds you to it and would teach you that salvation\nis past and that you must return <em>to</em> the past to find salvation. There\nis no fantasy which does not contain the dream of retribution for the\npast. Would you act out the dream or let it go?</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> In the special relationship, it does not <em>seem</em> to be an acting out\nof vengeance which you seek. And even when the hatred and the savagery\nbreak briefly through into awareness, the illusion of love is not\nprofoundly shaken. Yet the one thing which the ego never allows to reach\nawareness is that the special relationship is the acting out of\nvengeance on <em>yourself</em>. But what else <em>could</em> it be? In seeking the\nspecial relationship, you look not for glory in <em>yourself</em>. You have\ndenied that it is <em>there</em>, and the relationship becomes your\n<em>substitute</em> for it. And vengeance becomes your substitute for\nAtonement, and the <em>escape</em> from vengeance becomes your <em>loss</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> Against the ego’s insane notion of salvation, the Holy Spirit gently\nlays the holy instant. We said before that the Holy Spirit must teach\nthrough comparisons and uses opposites to point to truth. The holy\ninstant is the <em>opposite</em> of the ego’s fixed belief in salvation through\nvengeance for the past. In the holy instant, it is accepted that the\npast is gone, and with its passing the drive for vengeance has been\nuprooted and has disappeared. The stillness and the peace of <em>now</em>\nenfolds you in perfect gentleness. Everything is gone except the truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> For a time you may attempt to bring illusions into the holy instant\nto hinder your full awareness of the <em>complete</em> difference in all\nrespects between your experience of truth and illusion. Yet you will not\nattempt this long. In the holy instant, the power of the Holy Spirit\nwill prevail because you <em>joined</em> Him. The illusions you bring with you\nwill weaken the experience of Him for a while and will prevent you from\nkeeping the experience in your mind. Yet the holy instant <em>is</em> eternal,\nand your illusions of time will not prevent the timeless from being what\nit is nor you from experiencing it as it is.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> What God has given you is truly given and will be truly <em>received</em>.\nFor God’s gifts <em>have</em> no reality apart from your receiving them. <em>Your</em>\nreceiving completes His <em>giving</em>. You will receive <em>because</em> it is His\nWill to give. He gave the holy instant to be given you, and it is\nimpossible that you receive it not, <em>because</em> He gave it. When He willed\nthat His Son be free, His Son <em>was</em> free. In the holy instant is His\nreminder that His Son will always be <em>exactly</em> as he was created. And\neverything the Holy Spirit teaches you is to remind you that you <em>have</em>\nreceived what God has given you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> There is nothing you can hold against reality. All that must be\nforgiven are the illusions you have held against your brothers. Their\nreality <em>has</em> no past, and only illusions can <em>be</em> forgiven. God holds\nnothing against anyone, for He is incapable of illusions of <em>any</em> kind.\nRelease your brothers from the slavery of their illusions by forgiving\nthem for the illusions which <em>you</em> perceive in them. Thus will you learn\nthat <em>you</em> have been forgiven, for it is <em>you</em> who offered them\nillusions. In the holy instant, this is done for you <em>in time</em> to bring\nto you the true condition of Heaven.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> Remember that you always choose between truth and illusion—between\nthe <em>real</em> Atonement which would heal and the ego’s “atonement” which\nwould destroy. The power of God and all His Love, without limit, will\nsupport you as you seek only your place in the plan of Atonement arising\nfrom His Love. Be an ally of God and not the ego in seeking how\nAtonement can come to you. His help suffices, for His Messenger\nunderstands how to restore the Kingdom to you and to place <em>all</em> your\ninvestment in salvation in your relationship with Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> Seek and <em>find</em> his message in the holy instant, where all illusions\nare forgiven. From there the miracle extends to bless everyone and to\nresolve all problems, be they perceived as great or small, possible or\nimpossible. There is nothing that will not give place to Him and to His\nmajesty. To join in close relationship with Him is to accept\nrelationships as <em>real</em> and through their reality to give over all\nillusions for the reality of your relationship with God. Praise be to\nyour relationship with Him and to no other. The truth lies here and\nnowhere else. You choose this or <em>nothing</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> <em>Forgive us our illusions, Father, and help us to accept our true\nrelationship with You in which there are no illusions and where none can\never enter. Our holiness is Yours. What can there be in us that\n<strong>needs</strong> forgiveness when Yours is perfect? The sleep of\nforgetfulness is only the unwillingness to remember Your forgiveness and\nYour Love. Let us not wander into temptation, for the temptation of the\nSon of God is not Your will. And let us receive only what <strong>you</strong>\nhave given and accept but this into the minds which You created and\nwhich You love. Amen</em>.</p>\n\n",

You believe that truth cannot deal with them only because you\nwould <em>keep</em> them from truth. Very simply, your lack of faith in the\npower that heals all pain arises from your wish to retain some aspects\nof reality for fantasy. If you but realized what this must do to your\nappreciation of the whole! What you reserve unto yourself, you <em>take\naway</em> from Him Who would release you. Unless you give it back, it is\ninevitable that your perspective on reality be warped and uncorrected.</p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup> As long as you would have it so, so long will the illusion of order of\ndifficulty in miracles remain with you. For you have <em>established</em> this\norder in reality by giving some of it to one teacher and some to\nanother. And so you learn to deal with part of truth in one way and in\nanother way the other part. To fragment truth is to destroy it by\nrendering it meaningless. Orders of reality is a perspective without\nunderstanding, a frame of reference for reality to which it cannot\nreally <em>be</em> compared at all.</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> Think you that you can bring truth to fantasy and learn what truth\nmeans from the perspective of illusions? Truth <em>has</em> no meaning in\nillusion. The frame of reference for its meaning must be <em>itself</em>. When\nyou try to bring truth to illusions, you are trying to make illusions\n<em>real</em> and keep them by <em>justifying</em> your belief in them. But to give\nillusions to truth is to enable truth to teach that the <em>illusions</em> are\nunreal and thus enable you to escape from them. Reserve not one idea\naside from truth, or you establish orders of reality which must imprison\nyou. There <em>is</em> no order in reality because <em>everything</em> there is true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> Be willing, then, to give all you have held outside the truth to Him\nwho <em>knows</em> the truth and in Whom all is brought to truth. [Salvation\nfrom separation will be complete or will be not at all.] Be not\nconcerned with anything except your <em>willingness</em> to have this be\naccomplished. <em>He</em> will accomplish it; <em>not</em> you. But forget not this:\nWhen you become disturbed and lose your peace of mind because <em>another</em>\nis attempting to solve his problems through fantasy, you are refusing to\nforgive <em>yourself</em> for just this same attempt. And you are holding\n<em>both</em> of you away from truth and from salvation. As you forgive him,\nyou restore to truth what was denied by <em>both</em> of you. And you will see\nforgiveness where you have <em>given</em> it.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>7</sup> Can you imagine how beautiful those you forgive will look to you? In\nno fantasy have you ever seen anything so lovely. Nothing you see here,\nsleeping or waking, comes near to such loveliness. And nothing will you\nvalue like unto this nor hold so dear. Nothing that you remember that\nmade your heart seem to sing with joy has ever brought you even a little\npart of the happiness this sight will bring you. For you will see the\nSon of God. You will behold the beauty which the Holy Spirit loves to\nlook upon and which He thanks the Father for. He was created to see this\nfor <em>you</em> until you learn to see it for yourself. And all His teaching\nleads to seeing it and giving thanks with Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> This loveliness is <em>not</em> a fantasy. It is the real world, bright and\nclean and new with everything sparkling under the open sun. Nothing is\nhidden here, for everything has been forgiven, and there are no\nfantasies to hide the truth. The bridge between that world and this is\nso little and so easy to cross that you could not believe it is the\nmeeting place of worlds so different. Yet this little bridge is the\nstrongest thing that touches on this world at all. This little step, so\nsmall it has escaped your notice, is a stride through time into eternity\nand beyond all ugliness into beauty that will enchant you and will never\ncease to cause you wonderment at its perfection.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> This step, the smallest ever taken by anything, is still the greatest\naccomplishment of all in God’s plan of Atonement. All else is learned,\nbut this is <em>given</em>, complete and wholly perfect. No one but Him Who\nplanned salvation could complete it thus. The real world, in its\nloveliness, you <em>learn</em> to reach. Fantasies are all undone, and no one\nand nothing remains still bound by them, and by your <em>own</em> forgiveness,\nyou are free to see. Yet what you see is only what you have made, with\nthe blessing of your forgiveness on it. And with this final blessing of\nGod’s Son upon <em>himself</em>, the real perception, born of the new\nperspective he has learned, has served its purpose.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> The stars will disappear in light, and the sun which opened up the\nworld to beauty will vanish. Perception will be meaningless when it has\nbeen perfected, for everything that has been used for learning will have\nno function. Nothing will ever change; no shifts nor shadings, no\ndifferences, no variations which made perception possible will occur.\nThe perception of the real world will be so short that you will barely\nhave time to thank God for it. For God will take the last step swiftly\nwhen you have reached the real world and have been made ready for Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> The real world is attained simply by the complete forgiveness of the\nold, the world you see <em>without</em> forgiveness. The Great Transformer of\nperception will undertake with you the careful searching of the mind\nthat made this world and uncover to you the seeming reasons for your\nmaking it. In the light of the <em>real</em> reason which He brings, as you\nfollow Him, He will show you that there is no reason here at all. Each\nspot <em>His</em> reason touches grows alive with beauty, and what seemed ugly\nin the darkness of your lack of reason is suddenly released to\nloveliness. Not even what the Son of God made in insanity could be\nwithout a hidden spark of beauty which gentleness could release.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> All this beauty will rise to bless your sight as you look upon the\nworld with forgiving eyes. For forgiveness literally transforms vision\nand lets you see the real world reaching quietly and gently across chaos\nand removing all illusions which had twisted your perception and fixed\nit on the past. The smallest leaf becomes a thing of wonder and a blade\nof grass a sign of God’s perfection. From the forgiven world, the Son of\nGod is lifted easily into his home. And there he knows that he has\n<em>always</em> rested there in peace. Even salvation will become a dream and\nvanish from his mind. For salvation <em>is</em> the end of dreams and with the\nclosing of the dream will have no meaning. Who awake in Heaven could\ndream that there could ever be <em>need</em> of salvation?</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> How much do you <em>want</em> salvation? It will give you the real world,\ntrembling with readiness to <em>be</em> given you. The eagerness of the Holy\nSpirit to give you this is so intense He would not wait, although He\nwaits in patience. Meet His patience with your impatience at delay in\nmeeting Him. Go out in gladness to meet with your Redeemer and walk with\nhim in trust out of this world and into the real world of beauty and\nforgiveness.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>14</sup> To forgive is merely to remember only the <em>loving</em> thoughts you gave\nin the past and those that were given you. All the rest must be\nforgotten. Forgiveness is a selective remembering, based not on <em>your</em>\nselection. For the shadow figures you would make immortal are “enemies”\nof reality. Be willing to forgive the Son of God for what he did <em>not</em>\ndo. The shadow figures are the witnesses you bring with you to\ndemonstrate he did what he did <em>not</em>. Because you brought them, you will\nhear them. And you who kept them by your <em>own</em> selection do not\nunderstand how they came into your minds and what their purpose is.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> They represent the evil that you <em>think</em> was done to you. You bring\nthem with you only that you may return evil for evil, hoping that their\nwitness will enable you to think guiltily of another and <em>not</em> harm\nyourself. They speak so clearly for the separation that no one not\nobsessed with <em>keeping</em> separation could hear them. They offer you the\n“reasons” why you should enter into unholy alliances which support the\nego’s goals and make your relationships the witness to its power. It is\nthese shadow figures which would make the <em>ego</em> holy in your sight and\nteach you what you do to keep <em>it</em> safe is really love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> The shadow figures <em>always</em> speak for vengeance, and all\nrelationships into which they enter are totally insane. Without\nexception, these relationships have as their <em>purpose</em> the exclusion of\nthe truth about the other and of <em>yourself</em>. This is why you see in\n<em>both</em> what is not there and make of both the slaves of vengeance. And\nwhy whatever reminds you of your past grievances, no matter how\ndistorted the associations by which you arrive at the remembrance may\nbe, attracts you and seems to you to go by the name of love. And finally\nwhy all such relationships become the attempt at union through the\n<em>body</em>, for <em>only</em> bodies can be seen as means for vengeance. That\nbodies are central to all unholy relationships is evident. Your <em>own</em>\nexperience has taught you this. But what you do not realize are <em>all</em>\nthe reasons which go to make the relationship unholy. For unholiness\nseeks to <em>reinforce</em> itself, as holiness does, by gathering to itself\nwhat it perceives as like itself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> In the unholy relationship, it is not the body of the <em>other</em> with\nwhich union is attempted but the bodies of those who are not <em>there</em>.\nEven the body of the other, already a severely limited perception of\nhim, is not the central focus as it is or in entirety. What can be used\nfor fantasies of vengeance and what can be most readily associated with\nthose on whom vengeance is <em>really</em> sought are centered on and separated\n<em>off</em> as being the only parts of value. Every step taken in the making,\nthe maintaining, and the breaking off of the unholy relationship is a\nmove toward further fragmentation and unreality. The shadow figures\nenter more and more, and the one in whom they seem to be <em>decreases</em> in\nimportance.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> Time is indeed unkind to the unholy relationship. For time <em>is</em> cruel\nin the ego’s hands, as it is kind when used for gentleness. The\nattraction of the unholy relationship begins to fade and to be\nquestioned almost at once. Once it is formed, doubt <em>must</em> enter in\nbecause its purpose <em>is</em> impossible. The only such relationships which\nretain the fantasies that center on them are those which have been\ndreamed of but have not been made at all. Where no reality has entered,\nthere is nothing to intrude upon the dream of happiness. Yet consider\nwhat this means—the <em>more</em> reality that enters into the unholy\nrelationship, the <em>less satisfying</em> it becomes. And the more the\n<em>fantasies</em> can encompass, the <em>greater</em> the satisfaction seems to be.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> The “ideal” of the unholy relationship thus becomes one in which the\nreality of the other does not enter <em>at all</em> to “spoil” the dream. And\nthe less the other <em>really</em> brings to it, the “better” it becomes. Thus,\nthe attempt at union becomes a way of excluding even the one with whom\nthe union was sought. For it was formed to get him <em>out</em> of it and join\nwith fantasies in uninterrupted “bliss.” How can the Holy Spirit bring\nHis interpretation of the body as a means of communication into\nrelationships whose only purpose is <em>separation</em> from reality? What\nforgiveness <em>is</em> enables Him to do so.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> If <em>all</em> but loving thoughts has been forgotten, what remains <em>is</em>\neternal. And the transformed past is made like the <em>present</em>. No longer\ndoes the past conflict with <em>now</em>. <em>This</em> continuity <em>extends</em> the\npresent by increasing its reality and its <em>value</em> in your perception of\nit. In these loving thoughts is the spark of beauty hidden in the\nugliness of the unholy relationship in which the hatred is remembered,\nyet <em>there</em> to come alive as the relationship is given to Him Who gives\nit life and beauty. That is why Atonement centers on the past, which is\nthe <em>source</em> of separation, and where it must be undone. For separation\nmust be corrected where it was <em>made</em>. The ego seeks to “resolve” its\nproblems, not at their source, but where they were <em>not</em> made. And thus\nit seeks to guarantee there <em>will</em> be no solution.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> The Holy Spirit wills only to make His resolutions complete and\nperfect, and so He seeks and <em>finds</em> the source of problems where it\n<em>is</em> and there undoes it. And with each step in His undoing is the\n<em>separation</em> more and more undone and union brought closer. He is not at\nall confused by any “reasons” for separation. <em>All</em> He perceives in\nseparation is that it must be <em>undone</em>. Let Him uncover the hidden spark\nof beauty in your relationships and <em>show</em> it to you. Its loveliness\nwill so attract you that you will be unwilling ever to lose the sight of\nit again. And you will let it transform the relationship so you can see\nit more and more. For you will <em>want</em> it more and more and become\nincreasingly unwilling to let it be hidden from you. And you will learn\nto seek for and <em>establish</em> conditions in which this beauty can be seen.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> All this you will do gladly if you but let Him hold the spark before\nyou to light your way and make it clear to you. God’s Son is one. Whom\nGod has joined as one, the ego <em>cannot</em> break apart. The spark of\nholiness <em>must</em> be safe, however hidden it may be, in every\nrelationship. For the Creator of the one relationship has left no part\nof it without Himself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> This is the <em>only</em> part of the relationship the Holy Spirit sees\nbecause He knows that <em>only</em> this is true. You have made the\nrelationship unreal and therefore unholy by seeing it <em>where</em> it is not\nand <em>as</em> it is not. Give the past to Him Who can change your mind about\nit <em>for</em> you. But first be sure you fully realize what <em>you</em> have made\nthe past to represent and why.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> In brief, the past is now your justification for entering into a\ncontinuing, unholy alliance with the ego <em>against</em> the present. For the\npresent <em>is</em> forgiveness. Therefore, the relationships which the unholy\nalliance dictates are not perceived nor felt as <em>now</em>. Yet the frame of\nreference to which the present is referred for meaning is an <em>illusion</em>\nof the past in which those elements which fit the purpose of the unholy\nalliance are retained and all the rest let go. And what is thus let go\nis all the truth the past could ever offer to the present as witnesses\nfor its reality, while what is kept but witnesses to the reality of\ndreams.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> It is still up to you to choose to be willing to join with truth or\nillusion. But remember that to choose <em>one</em> is to let the other <em>go</em>.\nWhich one you choose you will endow with beauty and reality because the\nchoice <em>depends</em> on which you value more. The spark of beauty or the\nveil of ugliness, the real world or the world of guilt and fear, truth\nor illusion, freedom or slavery—it is all the same. For you can never\nchoose <em>except</em> between God and the ego. Thought systems are but true or\nfalse, and all their attributes come simply from what they <em>are</em>. Only\nthe Thoughts of God are true. And all that follows from them comes from\nwhat they are and is as true as is the holy Source from which they came.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> My holy brothers, I would enter into all your relationships and step\nbetween you and your fantasies. Let <em>my</em> relationship to you be real to\nyou, and let me bring reality to your perception of your brothers. They\nwere not created to enable you to hurt yourselves through them. They\nwere created to <em>create</em> with you. This is the truth that I would\ninterpose between you and your goal of madness. Be not separate from me,\nand let not the holy purpose of Atonement be lost to you in dreams of\nvengeance. Relationships in which such dreams are cherished have\n<em>excluded</em> me. Let me enter in the Name of God and bring you peace that\nyou may offer peace to me.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>27</sup> God established His relationship with you to make you happy, and\nnothing you do which does not share His purpose can be real. The purpose\nGod ascribed to anything is its only function. Because of His reason for\ncreating His relationship with you, the function of relationships became\nforever “to make happy.” <em>And nothing else</em>. To fulfill this function,\nyou relate to your creations as God to His. For nothing God created is\napart from happiness, and nothing God created but would <em>extend</em>\nhappiness as its Creator did. Whatever fulfills this function not\n<em>cannot</em> be real.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> In this world it is impossible to create, yet it <em>is</em> possible to\nmake happy. We have said repeatedly that the Holy Spirit would not\n<em>deprive</em> you of your special relationships but would <em>transform</em> them.\nAnd by that all that is meant is that He will restore to them the\nfunction given them by God. The function you have given them is clearly\n<em>not</em> to make happy. But the holy relationship shares God’s purpose,\nrather than aiming to make a substitute for it. Every special\nrelationship which <em>you</em> have made is a substitute for God’s Will and\nglorifies yours instead of His because of the delusion that they are\n<em>different</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> You have made very real relationships even in this world which you do\nnot recognize simply because you have raised their substitutes to such\npredominance that when truth calls to you, as it does constantly, you\nanswer with a substitute. Every special relationship which you have ever\nundertaken has as its fundamental purpose the aim of occupying your\nminds so completely that you will not <em>hear</em> the call of truth. In a\nsense the special relationship was the ego’s answer to the creation of\nthe Holy Spirit, Who was God’s answer to the separation. For although\nthe ego did not understand what had been created, it <em>was</em> aware of\nthreat.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> The whole defense system which the ego evolved to protect the\nseparation from the Holy Spirit was in response to the gift with which\nGod blessed it and by His blessing enabled it to be healed. This\nblessing holds within <em>itself</em> the truth about everything. And the truth\nis that the Holy Spirit is in close relationship with you because in Him\nis your relationship with God restored to you. The relationship with Him\nhas <em>never</em> been broken because the Holy Spirit has not been separate\nfrom anyone since the separation. And through Him have all your holy\nrelationships been carefully preserved to serve God’s purpose for you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> The ego is hyperalert to threat, and the part of your mind into which\nthe ego was accepted is very anxious to preserve its reason as it sees\nit. It does not realize that it is totally insane. And you must realize\njust what this means if <em>you</em> would be restored to sanity. The insane\nprotect their thought systems, but they do so <em>insanely</em>. And <em>all</em>\ntheir defenses are as insane as what they are supposed to protect. The\nseparation has <em>nothing</em> in it, no part, no “reason,” and no attribute\nthat is <em>not</em> insane. And its “protection” is part of it, as insane as\nthe whole. The special relationship, which is its chief defense, <em>must</em>\ntherefore be insane.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> You have but little difficulty now in realizing that the thought\nsystem which the special relationship protects is but a system of\ndelusions. You recognize, at least in general terms, that the ego is\ninsane. Yet the special relationship still seems to you somehow to be\n“different.” Yet we have looked at it far closer than at many other\naspects of the ego’s thought system which you have been more willing to\nlet go. While this one remains, you will <em>not</em> let the others go. For\nthis one is <em>not</em> different. Retain this one, and you <em>have</em> retained\nthe whole.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> It is essential to realize that all defenses <em>do</em> what they would\n<em>defend</em>. The underlying basis for their effectiveness is that they\n<em>offer</em> what they defend. What they defend is placed <em>in</em> them for\nsafekeeping, and as they operate, they <em>bring</em> it to you. Every defense\noperates by giving gifts, and the gift is <em>always</em> a miniature of the\nthought system the defense protects, set in a golden frame. The frame is\nvery elaborate, all set with jewels and deeply carved and polished. Its\npurpose is to be of value <em>in itself</em> and to divert your attention from\nwhat it encloses. But the frame <em>without</em> the picture you cannot have.\nDefenses operate to make you think you <em>can</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> The special relationship has the most imposing and deceptive frame of\nall the defenses the ego uses. Its thought system is offered here,\nsurrounded by a frame so heavy and so elaborate that the picture is\nalmost obliterated by its imposing structure. Into the frame are woven\nall sorts of fanciful and fragmented illusions of love, set with dreams\nof sacrifice and self-aggrandizement and interlaced with gilded threads\nof self-destruction. The glitter of blood shines like rubies, and the\ntears are faceted like diamonds and gleam in the dim light in which the\noffering is made.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> Look at the <em>picture</em>. Do not let the frame distract you. This gift\nis given you for your damnation, and if you take it, you will believe\nthat you <em>are</em> damned. You <em>cannot</em> have the frame without the picture.\nWhat you value is the <em>frame</em>, for there you see no conflict. Yet the\nframe is only the wrapping for the gift of conflict. The frame is <em>not</em>\nthe gift. Be not deceived by the most superficial aspects of this\nthought system, for these aspects enclose the whole, complete in <em>every</em>\naspect. Death lies in this glittering gift. Let not your gaze dwell on\nthe hypnotic gleaming of the frame. Look at the <em>picture</em>, and realize\nthat <em>death</em> is offered you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> That is why the holy instant is so important in the defense of truth.\nThe truth itself <em>needs</em> no defense, but you <em>do</em> need defense against\nyour own acceptance of the gift of death. When you who are truth accept\nan idea so dangerous <em>to</em> truth, you threaten truth with destruction.\nAnd your defense must now be undertaken to keep truth <em>whole</em>. The power\nof Heaven, the love of God, the tears of Christ, and the joy of His\neternal Spirit are marshaled to defend you from your own attack. For you\nattack Them, being <em>part</em> of Them, and They must save you, for They love\nThemselves.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> The holy instant is a miniature of Heaven, sent you <em>from</em> Heaven. It\nis a picture, too, set in a frame. Yet if you accept <em>this</em> gift, you\nwill not see the frame at all because the gift can only be accepted\nthrough your willingness to focus <em>all</em> your attention on the <em>picture</em>.\nThe holy instant is a miniature of eternity. It is a picture of\ntimelessness, set in a frame of time. If you focus on the picture, you\nwill realize that it was only the frame that made you think it <em>was</em> a\npicture. Without the frame, the picture is seen as what it <em>represents</em>.\nFor as the whole thought system of the ego lies in its gifts, so the\nwhole of Heaven lies in this instant, borrowed from eternity and set in\ntime for you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> Two gifts are offered you. Each is complete and cannot be partially\naccepted. Each is a picture of all that you can have, seen <em>very</em>\ndifferently. You cannot compare their value by comparing a picture to a\nframe. It must be the pictures only that you compare, or the comparison\nis wholly without meaning. Remember that it is the picture that is the\ngift. And only on this basis are you <em>really</em> free to choose. Look at\nthe pictures. <em>Both</em> of them. One is a tiny picture, hard to see at all\nbeneath the heavy shadows of its enormous and disproportionate\nenclosure. The other is lightly framed and hung in light, lovely to look\nupon for what it <em>is</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> You who have tried so hard and are <em>still</em> trying to fit the better\npicture into the wrong frame and so combine what cannot <em>be</em> combined,\naccept this and be glad: these pictures are each framed perfectly for\nwhat they represent. One is framed to be out of focus and not seen. The\nother is framed for perfect clarity. The picture of darkness and of\ndeath grows less convincing as you search it out amid its wrappings. As\neach senseless stone which seems to shine in darkness from the frame is\nexposed to light, it becomes dull and lifeless and ceases to distract\nyou from the picture. And finally you look upon the picture itself,\nseeing at last that, unprotected by the frame, it <em>has</em> no meaning.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> The other picture is lightly framed, for time cannot contain\neternity. There <em>is</em> no distraction here. The picture of Heaven and\neternity grows <em>more</em> convincing as you look at it. And now by <em>real</em>\ncomparison a transformation of both pictures can at last occur. And each\nis given its rightful place, when both are seen in relation to each\nother. The dark picture brought to light is not perceived as fearful,\nbut the fact that it is just a <em>picture</em> is brought home at last. And\nwhat you see there, you will recognize as what it is—a picture of what\nyou <em>thought</em> was real and nothing more. For beyond this picture, you\nwill see nothing.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> The picture of light, in clear cut and unmistakable contrast, is\ntransformed <em>into</em> what lies beyond the picture. As you look on this,\nyou realize that it is <em>not</em> a picture but a <em>reality</em>. This is no\nfigured representation of a thought system, but the Thought Itself. What\n<em>it</em> represents is <em>there</em>. The frame fades gently, and God rises to\nyour remembrance, offering you the whole of creation in exchange for\nyour little picture, wholly without value and entirely deprived of\nmeaning.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> As God ascends into His rightful place and you to yours, you will\nexperience again the <em>meaning</em> of relationship and know it to be true.\nLet us ascend in peace together to the Father by giving <em>Him</em> ascendance\nin our minds. We will gain <em>everything</em> by giving Him the power and the\nglory and keeping no illusions of where they are. They are in <em>us</em>\nthrough <em>His</em> ascendance. What He has given is <em>His</em>. It shines in every\npart of Him as in the whole. The whole reality of your relationship with\nHim lies in <em>our</em> relationship to one another. The holy instant shines\nalike on all relationships, for in it they <em>are</em> one. For here is only\nhealing, <em>already</em> complete and perfect. For here is God, and where He\nis, only the perfect and complete <em>can</em> be.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>43</sup> The holy relationship is the expression of the holy instant in living\nin this world. Like everything about salvation, the holy instant is a\npractical device, witnessed to by its results. The holy instant <em>never</em>\nfails. The experience of it is <em>always</em> felt. Yet without expression, it\nis not <em>remembered</em>. The holy relationship is a constant reminder of the\nexperience in which the relationship became what it is. And as the\nunholy relationship is a continuing hymn of hate in praise of <em>its</em>\nmaker, so is the holy relationship a happy song of praise to the\nRedeemer of relationships.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> The holy relationship, a major step toward the perception of the real\nworld, is learned. It is the old unholy relationship transformed and\nseen anew. The holy relationship is a phenomenal teaching\naccomplishment. In all its aspects, as it begins, develops, and becomes\naccomplished, it represents the <em>reversal</em> of the unholy relationship.\nBe comforted in this—the only difficult phase is the beginning. For\nhere, the goal of the relationship is abruptly shifted to the exact\nopposite of what it was. This is the first result of offering the\nrelationship to the Holy Spirit to use for <em>His</em> purposes.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> This invitation is accepted immediately, and the Holy Spirit wastes\nno time in introducing the practical results of asking Him to enter. <em>At\nonce</em> His goal replaces yours. This is accomplished very rapidly, but it\nmakes the relationship seem disturbed, disjunctive, and even quite\ndistressing. The reason is quite clear. For the relationship as it <em>is</em>,\nis out of line with its own goal and clearly unsuited to the purpose\nwhich has been accepted for it. In its unholy condition, <em>your</em> goal was\nall that seemed to give it meaning. Now it seems to make no sense. Many\nrelationships have been broken off at this point, and the pursuit of the\nold goal reestablished in another relationship. For once the unholy\nrelationship has <em>accepted</em> the goal of holiness, it can never again be\nwhat it was.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> The temptation of the ego becomes extremely intense with this shift\nin goals. For the relationship has not as yet been changed sufficiently\nto make its former goal completely without attraction, and its structure\nis “threatened” by the recognition of its inappropriateness for meeting\nits new purpose. The conflict between the goal and the structure of the\nrelationship is so apparent that they <em>cannot</em> coexist. Yet now the goal\nwill <em>not</em> be changed. Set firmly in the unholy relationship, there <em>is</em>\nno course except to <em>change</em> the relationship to fit the goal. Until\nthis happy solution is seen and accepted as the <em>only</em> way out of the\nconflict, the relationship seems to be severely strained.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> It would not be kinder to shift the goal more slowly, for the\ncontrast would be obscured and the ego given time to reinterpret each\nslow step according to its liking. Only a radical shift in purpose could\ninduce a complete change of mind about what the whole relationship is\n<em>for</em>. As this change develops and is finally accomplished, it grows\nincreasingly beneficent and joyous. But at the beginning, the situation\nis experienced as very precarious. A relationship undertaken by two\nindividuals for their unholy purposes suddenly has <em>holiness</em> for its\ngoal. As these two contemplate their relationship from the point of view\nof this new purpose, they are inevitably appalled. Their perception of\nthe relationship may even become quite disorganized. And yet, the former\norganization of their perception no longer serves the purpose they have\nagreed to meet.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> This is the time for <em>faith</em>. You <em>let</em> this goal be set for you.\nThat was an act of faith. Do not abandon faith, now that the rewards of\nfaith are being introduced. If you believed the Holy Spirit was there to\n<em>accept</em> the relationship, why would you now not still believe that He\nis there to purify what He has taken under His guidance? Have faith in\neach other in what but <em>seems</em> to be a trying time. The goal <em>is</em> set.\nAnd your relationship has sanity as its purpose. For now you find\nyourselves in an insane relationship, <em>recognized</em> as such in the light\nof its goal.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> Now the ego counsels thus—substitute for this <em>another</em> relationship\nto which your former goal was quite appropriate. You can escape from\nyour distress only by getting rid of each other. You need not part\nentirely if you choose not to do so. But you must exclude major areas of\nfantasy from each other to save your sanity. Hear not this now! Have\nfaith in Him Who answered you. He heard. Has He not been very explicit\nin His answer? You are not now wholly insane. Can you <em>deny</em> that He has\ngiven you a most explicit statement? Now He asks for faith a little\nlonger, even in bewilderment. For this will go, and you will see the\njustification for your faith emerge to bring you shining conviction.\nAbandon Him not now, nor each other. This relationship <em>has been</em> reborn\nas holy.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> Accept with gladness what you do not understand, and let it be\nexplained to you as you perceive its purpose work in it to <em>make</em> it\nholy. You will find many opportunities to blame each other for the\n“failure” of your relationship, for it will seem at times to have <em>no</em>\npurpose. A sense of aimlessness will come to haunt you and to remind you\nof all the ways you once sought for satisfaction and thought you found\nit. Forget not now the misery you <em>really</em> found, and do not now breathe\nlife into your failing egos. For your relationship has <em>not</em> been\ndisrupted. It has been <em>saved</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> You are very new in the ways of salvation and think you have lost\nyour way. <em>Your</em> way <em>is</em> lost, but think not this is <em>loss</em>. In your\nnewness, remember that you have started again <em>together</em>. And take each\nother’s hand to walk together along a road far more familiar than you\nnow believe. Is it not certain that you will remember a goal unchanged\nthroughout eternity? For you have chosen but the goal of God from which\nyour true intent was <em>never</em> absent.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> Throughout the Sonship is the song of freedom heard in joyous echo of\nyour choice. You have joined with many in the holy instant, and they\nhave joined with you. Think not your choice will leave you comfortless,\nfor God Himself has blessed your holy relationship. Join in His\nblessing, and withhold not yours upon it. For all it needs now <em>is</em> your\nblessing that you may see that in it rests salvation. Condemn salvation\nnot, for it <em>has</em> come to you. And welcome it together, for it has come\nto <em>join</em> you together in a relationship in which all the Sonship is\ntogether blessed.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> You undertook together to invite the Holy Spirit into your\nrelationship. He could not have entered otherwise. Although you may have\nmade many mistakes since then, you have also made enormous efforts to\nhelp Him do His work. And He has not been lacking in appreciation for\nall you have done for Him. Nor does He see the mistakes at all. Have you\nbeen similarly grateful to each other? Have you consistently appreciated\nthe good efforts and overlooked mistakes? Or has your appreciation\nflickered and grown dim in what seemed to be the light of the mistakes?\nYou are now entering upon a campaign to blame each other for the\ndiscomfort of the situation in which you find yourselves. And by this\nlack of thanks and gratitude, you make yourselves unable to <em>express</em>\nthe holy instant, and thus you lose sight of it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> The experience of an instant, however compelling it may be, is easily\nforgotten if you allow time to close over it. It must be kept shining\nand gracious in your awareness of time but not concealed within it. The\ninstant remains. But where are <em>you</em>? To give thanks to each other is to\nappreciate the holy instant and thus enable its results to be accepted\nand <em>shared</em>. To <em>attack</em> each other is not to lose the instant but to\nmake it powerless in its <em>effects</em>. You <em>have</em> received the holy\ninstant, but you have established a condition in which you cannot <em>use</em>\nit. As a result, you do not realize that it is with you still. And by\ncutting yourself off from its expression, you have denied yourself its\nbenefit. You reinforce this every time you attack each other, for the\nattack must blind you to <em>yourself</em>. And it is impossible to deny\nyourself and recognize what has been given and received by you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> You stand together in the holy presence of truth itself. Here is the\ngoal, together <em>with</em> you. Think you not the goal itself will gladly\narrange the means for its accomplishment? It is just this same\ndiscrepancy between the purpose that has been accepted and the means as\nthey stand now which seems to make you suffer, but which makes Heaven\nglad. If Heaven were <em>outside</em> you, you could not share in its gladness.\nYet because it is within, the gladness, too, is yours. You <em>are</em> joined\nin purpose, but remain still separate and divided on the means.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Yet the goal is fixed, firm, and unalterable, and the means will\nsurely fall in place <em>because</em> the goal is sure. And you will share the\ngladness of the Sonship that it is so. As you begin to recognize and\naccept the gifts you have so freely given to each other, you will also\naccept the effects of the holy instant and use them to correct all your\nmistakes and free you from their results. And learning this, you will\nhave also learned how to release <em>all</em> the Sonship and offer it in\ngladness and thanksgiving to Him Who gave you <em>your</em> release, and Who\nwould extend it <em>through</em> you.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>57</sup> The practical application of the Holy Spirit’s purpose is extremely\nsimple, but it <em>is</em> unequivocal. In fact in order to be simple, it\n<em>must</em> be unequivocal. The simple is merely what is easily understood,\nand for this it is apparent that it must be clear. The setting of the\nHoly Spirit’s goal is general. Now He will work with you to make it\nspecific [for application <em>is</em> specific]. There are certain very\nspecific guidelines He provides for any situation, but remember that you\ndo not yet realize their universal application. Therefore it is\nessential at this point to use them in each situation separately, until\nyou can more safely look <em>beyond</em> each situation in an understanding far\nbroader than you now possess.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> In any situation in which you are uncertain, the first thing to\nconsider, very simply, is, “What do I want to come of this? What is it\n<em>for</em>?” The clarification of the goal belongs at the <em>beginning</em>, for it\nis this which will determine the outcome. In the ego’s procedure, this\nis reversed. The <em>situation</em> becomes the determiner of the outcome,\nwhich can be anything. The reason for this disorganized approach is\nevident. The ego does not know what it <em>wants</em> to come of it. It is\naware of what it does <em>not</em> want, but only that. It has no positive goal\nat all.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> Without a clear cut positive goal, set at the outset, the situation\njust seems to happen and makes no sense until it has <em>already</em> happened.\n<em>Then</em> you look back at it and try to piece together what it must have\nmeant. And you will be <em>wrong</em>. Not only is your judgment in the past,\nbut you have no idea what <em>should</em> happen. No goal was set with which to\nbring the means in line. And now the only judgment left to make is\nwhether or not the ego likes it—is it acceptable, or does it call for\nvengeance? The absence of a criterion for outcome set <em>in advance</em> makes\nunderstanding doubtful and evaluation impossible.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> The value of deciding in advance what you <em>want</em> to happen is simply\nthat you will perceive the situation as a means to <em>make</em> it happen. You\nwill therefore make every effort to overlook what interferes with the\naccomplishment of your objective and concentrate on everything which\nhelps you meet it. It is quite noticeable that this approach has brought\nyou closer to the Holy Spirit’s sorting out of truth and falsity. The\ntrue becomes what can be used to meet the goal. The false becomes the\nuseless from this point of view. The situation now has meaning, but only\nbecause the <em>goal</em> has made it meaningful.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> The goal of truth has further practical advantages. If the situation\nis used for truth and sanity, its outcome <em>must</em> be peace. And this is\nquite <em>apart</em> from what the outcome <em>is</em>. If peace is the condition of\ntruth and sanity and cannot be <em>without</em> them, where peace is <em>they</em>\nmust be. Truth comes of itself. If you experience peace, it is because\nthe truth has come to you, and you will see the outcome truly, for\ndeception cannot prevail against you. And you will recognize the outcome\n<em>because</em> you are at peace. Here again, you see the opposite of the\nego’s way of looking, for the ego believes the <em>situation</em> brings the\nexperience. The Holy Spirit knows that the situation is as the goal\ndetermines it and is experienced <em>according</em> to the goal.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> The goal of truth requires faith. Faith is implicit in the acceptance\nof the Holy Spirit’s purpose, and this faith is all-inclusive. Where the\ngoal of truth is set, there faith <em>must</em> be. The Holy Spirit sees the\nsituation as a <em>whole</em>. The goal establishes the fact that everyone\ninvolved in it will play his part in its accomplishment. This is\ninevitable. No one will fail in anything. This seems to ask for faith\nbeyond you and beyond what you can give. Yet this is so only from the\nviewpoint of the ego, for the ego believes in “solving” conflict through\nfragmentation and does <em>not</em> perceive the situation as a whole.\nTherefore, it seeks to split off segments of the situation and deal with\nthem <em>separately</em>, for it has faith in separation and not in wholeness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> Confronted with any aspect of the situation which seems to be\ndifficult, the ego will attempt to take this aspect elsewhere and\nresolve it there. And it will seem to be successful, except that this\nattempt conflicts with unity and <em>must</em> obscure the goal of truth. And\npeace will not be experienced except in fantasy. Truth has not come\nbecause faith has been denied, being withheld from where it rightfully\nbelonged. Thus do you lose the understanding of the situation the goal\nof truth would bring. For fantasy solutions bring but the illusion of\nexperience, and the illusion of peace is not the condition in which the\ntruth can enter.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> The substitutes for aspects of the situation are the witnesses to\nyour lack of faith. They demonstrate that you did not believe that the\nsituation and the <em>problem</em> were in the same place. The problem <em>was</em>\nthe lack of faith, and it is this you demonstrate when you remove it\nfrom its source and place it elsewhere. As a result, you do not see the\n<em>problem</em>. Had you not lacked the faith it could be solved, the problem\nwould be gone. And the situation would have been meaningful to you\nbecause the interference in the way of understanding would have been\nremoved. To remove the problem elsewhere is to <em>keep</em> it. For you remove\nyourself <em>from</em> it and make it unsolvable.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>65</sup> There is no problem in any situation that faith will not solve. There\nis no shift in any aspect of the problem but will make solution\nimpossible. For if you shift part of the problem elsewhere, the meaning\nof the problem <em>must</em> be lost, and the solution to the problem is\ninherent in its meaning. Is it not possible that all your problems\n<em>have</em> been solved, but you have removed yourself from the solution? Yet\nfaith must be where something has been done and where you <em>see</em> it done.\nA situation is a relationship, being the joining of thoughts. If\nproblems are perceived, it is because the thoughts are judged to be in\nconflict. But if the goal is truth, this is impossible. Some idea of\nbodies must have entered, for minds cannot attack.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> The thought of bodies is the sign of faithlessness, for bodies cannot\nsolve anything. And it is their intrusion on the relationship, an error\nin your thoughts <em>about</em> the situation, which then becomes the\njustification for your lack of faith. You <em>will</em> make this error, but be\nnot at all concerned with that. The error does not matter. Faithlessness\nbrought to faith will never interfere with truth. But faithlessness used\n<em>against</em> truth will always destroy faith. If you lack faith, ask that\nit be restored where it was <em>lost</em> and seek not to have it made up to\nyou elsewhere as if you had been unjustly deprived of it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> Only what <em>you</em> have not given can be lacking in <em>any</em> situation. But\nremember this: the goal of holiness was set for your relationship and\n<em>not</em> by you. You did not set it because holiness cannot be seen\n<em>except</em> through faith, and your relationship was not holy <em>because</em>\nyour faith in one another was so limited and little. Your faith must\ngrow to meet the goal that has been set. The goal’s reality will call\nthis forth, for you will see that peace and faith will not come\nseparately. What situation <em>can</em> you be in without faith and remain\nfaithful to each other?</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> Every situation in which you find yourself is but a means to meet the\npurpose set for your relationship. See it as something else, and you\n<em>are</em> faithless. Use not your faithlessness. Let it enter and look upon\nit calmly, but do not <em>use</em> it. Faithlessness is the servant of illusion\nand wholly faithful to its master. Use it and it will carry you straight\nto illusions. Be tempted not by what it offers you. It interferes not\nwith the goal, but with the value of the goal to <em>you</em>. Accept not the\nillusion of peace it offers, but look upon its offering and recognize it\n<em>is</em> illusion.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> The goal of illusion is as closely tied to faithlessness as faith to\ntruth. If you lack faith in anyone to fulfill, and <em>perfectly</em>, his part\nin any situation dedicated in advance to truth, <em>your</em> dedication is\ndivided. And so you have been faithless to each other and used your\nfaithlessness <em>against</em> each other. No relationship is holy unless its\nholiness goes with it everywhere. As holiness and faith go hand in hand,\nso must its faith go everywhere with it. The goal’s reality will call\nforth and <em>accomplish</em> every miracle needed for its fulfillment. Nothing\ntoo small or too enormous, too weak or too compelling, but will be\ngently turned to its use and purpose. The universe will serve it gladly,\nas it serves the universe. But do not <em>interfere</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> The power set in you in whom the Holy Spirit’s goal has been\nestablished is so far beyond your little conception of the infinite that\nyou have no idea how great the strength that goes with you. And you can\nuse <em>this</em> in perfect safety. Yet for all its might, so great it reaches\npast the stars and to the universe that lies beyond them, your little\nfaithlessness can make it useless if you would use the faithlessness\ninstead.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> Yet think on this, and learn the <em>cause</em> of faithlessness: You think\nyou hold against the other what he has done to you. But what you really\nblame him for is what <em>you</em> did to <em>him</em>. It is not <em>his</em> past but\n<em>yours</em> you hold against him. And you lack faith in him because of what\n<em>you</em> were. Yet you are as innocent of what you were as he is. What\nnever was is causeless and is not <em>there</em> to interfere with truth. There\n<em>is</em> no cause for faithlessness, but there <em>is</em> a Cause for faith. That\nCause has entered any situation which shares Its purpose. The light of\ntruth shines from the center of the situation and touches everyone to\nwhom the situation’s purpose calls. It calls to <em>everyone</em>. There is no\nsituation which does not involve your <em>whole</em> relationship in every\naspect and complete in every part. You can leave nothing of yourself\noutside it and keep the situation holy. For it shares the purpose of\nyour whole relationship and derives its meaning from it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> Enter each situation with the faith that you give to each other, or\nyou <em>are</em> faithless to your own relationship. Your faith will call the\nothers to share your purpose, as this same purpose called forth the\nfaith in <em>you</em>. And you will see the means you once employed to lead you\nto illusions transformed to means for truth. [Truth calls for faith,\nand faith makes room <em>for truth</em>.] When the Holy Spirit changed the\npurpose of your relationship by exchanging yours for His, the goal He\nplaced there was extended to every situation in which you enter or will\n<em>ever</em> enter. And every situation was thus made free of the past, which\nwould have made it purposeless.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> You call for faith because of Him Who walks with you in <em>every</em>\nsituation. You are no longer wholly insane, nor no longer alone. For\nloneliness in God <em>must</em> be a dream. You whose relationship shares the\nHoly Spirit’s goal are set apart from loneliness because the truth has\ncome. Its call for faith is strong. Use not your faithlessness against\nit, for it calls you to salvation and to peace.</p>\n\n",

The meaning which the\nHoly Spirit’s purpose has given it is also given to every situation.

The holy instant\nis the shining example, the clear and unequivocal demonstration of the\nmeaning of every relationship and every situation, seen as a <em>whole</em>.\nFaith has accepted every aspect of the situation, and faithlessness has\nnot forced any exclusion on it. It is a situation of perfect peace\nsimply because you have let it be what it <em>is</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> This simple courtesy is all the Holy Spirit asks of you. Let truth be\nwhat it is. Do not intrude upon it, do not attack it, do not interrupt\nits coming. Let it encompass every situation and bring you peace. Not\neven faith is asked of you, for truth asks nothing. Let it enter, and it\nwill call forth and <em>secure</em> for you the faith you need for peace. But\nrise you not against it, for against your opposition it <em>cannot</em> come.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> Would you not <em>want</em> to make a holy instant of every situation?

What has been demonstrated has called for faith and has\nbeen <em>given</em> it. Now it becomes a fact from which faith can no longer\n<em>be</em> withheld. The strain of refusing faith to truth is enormous and far\ngreater than you realize. But to answer truth with faith entails no\nstrain at all.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> To you who have acknowledged the call of your Redeemer, the strain of\nnot responding to His call seems to be greater than before. This is not\nso. Before, the strain was there but you attributed it to something\nelse, believing that the “something else” produced it. This was <em>never</em>\ntrue. For what the “something else” produced was sorrow and depression,\nsickness and pain, darkness and dim imaginings of terror, cold fantasies\nof fear and fiery dreams of hell. And it was nothing but the intolerable\nstrain of refusing to give faith to truth and see its evident reality.</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> Such was the crucifixion of the Son of God. His faithlessness did\nthis to him. Think carefully before you let yourself use faithlessness\nagainst him. For he is risen, and you have accepted the cause of his\nawakening as yours. You have assumed your part in his redemption, and\nyou are now fully responsible to him. Fail him not now, for it has been\ngiven you to realize what your lack of faith in him must mean to <em>you</em>.\nHis salvation <em>is</em> your only purpose. See only this in every situation,\nand it will be a means for <em>bringing</em> only this.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> When you accepted truth as the goal for your relationship, you became\ngivers of peace as surely as your Father gave peace to you. For the goal\nof peace cannot be accepted apart from its conditions, and you <em>had</em>\nfaith in it, for no one accepts what he does not believe is real. Your\npurpose has not changed and <em>will</em> not change, for you accepted what can\n<em>never</em> change. And nothing that it needs to be forever changeless can\nyou now withhold from it.

To\nfragment is to exclude, and substitution is the strongest defense the\nego has for separation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> The Holy Spirit never uses substitutes. Where the ego perceives one\nperson as a replacement for another, the Holy Spirit sees them joined\nand indivisible. He does not judge between them, knowing they are one.\nBeing united, they are one because they are the <em>same</em>. Substitution is\nclearly a process in which they are perceived as different. One would\nunite; the other separate. Nothing can come between what God has joined\nand what the Holy Spirit sees as one. But everything <em>seems</em> to come\nbetween the fragmented relationships the ego sponsors to destroy.</p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup> The one emotion in which substitution is impossible is love. Fear\ninvolves substitution by definition, for it is love’s replacement. Fear\nis both a fragmented and a fragmenting emotion. It seems to take many\nforms, and each seems to require a different form of acting out for\nsatisfaction. While this appears to introduce quite variable behavior, a\nfar more serious effect lies in the fragmented perception from which the\nbehavior stems. No one is <em>seen complete</em>. The body is emphasized, with\nspecial emphasis on certain parts, and used as the standard for\ncomparison for either acceptance or rejection of suitability for acting\nout a special form of fear.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>4</sup> You who believe that God is fear made but one substitution. It has\ntaken many forms because it was the substitution of illusion for truth,\nof fragmentation for wholeness. It has become so splintered and\nsubdivided and divided again, over and over, that it is now almost\nimpossible to perceive it once was one and still is what it was. That\none error, which brought truth to illusion, infinity to time, and life\nto death, was all you ever made. Your whole world rests upon it.\nEverything you see reflects it, and every special relationship which you\nhave ever made is part of it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> You have expressed surprise at hearing how very different is reality\nfrom what you see. You do not realize the magnitude of that one error.\nIt was so vast and so completely incredible that from it a world of\ntotal unreality <em>had</em> to emerge. What else <em>could</em> come of it? Its\nfragmented aspects are fearful enough, as you begin to look at them. But\nnothing you have seen begins to show you the enormity of the original\nerror, which seemed to cast you out of Heaven, to shatter knowledge into\nmeaningless bits of disunited perceptions, and to force you to further\nsubstitutions.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> That was the first projection of error outward. The world arose to\nhide it and became the screen on which it was projected and drawn\nbetween you and the truth. For truth extends <em>inward</em>, where the idea of\nloss is meaningless and only increase is conceivable. Do you really\nthink it strange that a world in which everything is backwards and\nupside-down arose from this? [<em>It was inevitable</em>.] For truth brought\nto <em>this</em> could only remain within in quiet and take no part in all the\nmad projection by which this world was made. Call it not sin but\nmadness, for such it was, and so it still remains. Invest it not with\nguilt, for guilt implies it was accomplished in reality. And above all,\nbe not <em>afraid</em> of it. When you seem to see some twisted form of the\noriginal error rise to frighten you, say only, “God is not fear, but\nlove,” and it will disappear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> The truth will <em>save</em> you. It has not left you to go out into the mad\nworld and so depart from you. Inward is sanity; insanity is <em>outside</em>\nyou. You but <em>believe</em> it is the other way; that truth is outside and\nerror and guilt within. Your little senseless substitutions, touched\nwith insanity and swirling lightly off on a mad course like feathers\ndancing insanely in the wind, have <em>no</em> substance. They fuse and merge\nand separate in shifting and totally meaningless patterns which need not\nbe judged at all. To judge them individually is pointless. Their tiny\ndifferences in form are no real differences at all. <em>None</em> of them\nmatters. <em>That</em> they have in common and nothing else. Yet what else is\n<em>necessary</em> to make them all the same?</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> Let them all go, dancing in the wind, dipping and turning till they\ndisappear from sight, far, far outside you. And turn you to the stately\ncalm within, where in holy stillness dwells the living God you never\nleft and Who never left you. The Holy Spirit takes you gently by the\nhand and retraces with you your mad journey outside yourself, leading\nyou gently back to the truth and safety within. He brings all your\ninsane projections and your wild substitutions which you have placed\noutside you to the truth. Thus He reverses the course of insanity and\nrestores you to reason.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> In your relationship, where He has taken charge of everything at your\nrequest, He has set the course inward to the truth you share. In the mad\nworld outside you, nothing can be shared but only substituted, and\nsharing and substituting have nothing in common in reality. Within\nyourselves you love each other with a perfect love. Here is holy ground\nin which no substitution can enter and where only the truth about each\nother can abide. Here you are joined in God, as much together as you are\nwith Him. The original error has not entered here, nor ever will. Here\nis the radiant truth to which the Holy Spirit has committed your\nrelationship. Let Him bring it here, where <em>you</em> would have it be. Give\nHim but a little faith in each other, to help Him show you that no\nsubstitute you made for Heaven can keep you from it. In you there <em>is</em>\nno separation, and no substitute can keep you from each other. Your\nreality was God’s creation and <em>has</em> no substitute.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> You are so firmly joined in truth that only God is there. And He\nwould never accept something else instead of you. He loves you both,\nequally and as one. And as He loves you, so you <em>are</em>. You are not\njoined together in illusions but in the Thought so holy and so perfect\nthat illusions cannot remain to darken the holy place in which you stand\ntogether. God is with you, my brothers. Let us join in Him in peace and\ngratitude and accept His gift as our most holy and perfect reality,\nwhich we share in Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> Heaven is restored to all the Sonship through your relationship, for\nin it lies the Sonship, whole and beautiful, safe in your love. Heaven\nhas entered quietly, for all illusions have been gently brought unto the\ntruth in you and love has shined upon you, blessing your relationship\nwith truth. God and His whole creation have entered it together. How\nlovely and how holy is your relationship, with the truth shining upon\nit! Heaven beholds it and rejoices that you have let it come to you.\n[And God Himself is glad that your relationship is as it was created.]\nThe universe within you stands with you, together. And Heaven looks with\nlove on what is joined in it, along with its Creator.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> Whom God has called should hear no substitutes. Their call is but an\necho of the original error which shattered Heaven. And what became of\npeace in those who heard? Return with me to Heaven, walking together out\nof this world and through another to the loveliness and joy the other\nholds within it. Would you still further weaken and break apart what is\nalready broken and hopeless? Is it here that you would look for\nhappiness? Or would you not prefer to heal what has been broken and join\nin making whole what has been ravaged by separation and disease?</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> You have been called together to the most holy function that this\nworld contains. It is the only one which has no limits and reaches out\nto every broken fragment of the Sonship with healing and uniting\ncomfort. This is offered <em>you</em> in your holy relationship. Accept it\nhere, and you will give as you have accepted. The peace of God is given\nyou with the glowing purpose in which you join. The holy light that\nbrought you together must extend, as <em>you</em> accepted it.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>14</sup> Does not a world that seems quite real arise in dreams? Yet think\nwhat this world is. It is clearly <em>not</em> the world you saw before you\nslept. Rather, it is a distortion of the world, planned solely around\nwhat you would have preferred. Here, you are “free” to make over\nwhatever seemed to attack you and change it into a tribute to your ego,\nwhich was outraged by the “attack.” This would not <em>be</em> your wish unless\nyou saw yourself as one with the ego, which always looks upon itself and\ntherefore on you as under attack and highly vulnerable to it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> Dreams are chaotic <em>because</em> they are governed by your conflicting\nwishes, and therefore they have no <em>concern</em> with what is true. They are\nthe best example you could have of how perception can be utilized to\nsubstitute illusions for truth. You do not take them seriously on\nawaking because the fact that reality is so outrageously violated in\nthem becomes apparent. Yet they are a way of looking at the world and\nchanging it to suit the ego better. They provide striking examples both\nof the ego’s inability to tolerate reality and your willingness to\n<em>change</em> reality on its behalf.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> You do not find the differences between what you see in sleep and on\nawaking disturbing. You recognize that what you see on waking is blotted\nout in dreams. Yet on awakening, you do not expect it to be gone. In\ndreams <em>you</em> arrange everything. People become what you would have them\nbe, and what they do <em>you</em> order. No limit on substitution is laid upon\nyou. For a time, it seems as if the world were given you, to make it\nwhat you will. You do not realize that you are <em>attacking</em> it, trying to\ntriumph over it and make it serve you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> Dreams are perceptual temper tantrums in which you literally scream,\n“I want it <em>thus</em>!” And thus it seems to be. And yet the dream cannot\nescape its origin. Anger and fear pervade it, and in an instant, the\nillusion of satisfaction is invaded by the illusion of terror. For the\ndream of your ability to control reality by substituting a world which\nyou prefer <em>is</em> terrifying. Your attempts to blot out reality are very\nfearful, but this you are not willing to accept. And so you substitute\nthe fantasy that <em>reality</em> is fearful, not what you would <em>do</em> to it.\nAnd thus is guilt made real.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> Dreams show you that you <em>have</em> the power to make a world as you\nwould have it be, and that because you <em>want</em> it, you <em>see</em> it. And\nwhile you see it, you do not doubt that it is real. Yet here is a world,\nclearly within your mind, that seems to be <em>outside</em>. You do not respond\nto it as though you made it, nor do you realize that the emotions which\nthe dream produces <em>must</em> come from you. It is the figures in the dream\nand what <em>they</em> do that seem to make the dream. You do not realize that\nyou are making them act out for <em>you</em>, for if you did, the guilt would\nnot be theirs, and the illusion of satisfaction would be gone. In dreams\nthese features are not obscure. You seem to waken, and the dream is\ngone. Yet what you fail to recognize is that what caused the dream has\nnot gone with it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> Your wish to make another world that is not real <em>remains</em> with you.\nAnd what you seem to wake to is but another form of this same world you\nsee in dreams. All your time is spent in dreaming. Your sleeping and\nyour waking dreams have different forms, and that is all. Their\n<em>content</em> is the same. They are your protest against reality and your\nfixed and insane idea that you can change it. In your waking dreams, the\nspecial relationship [has a special place. It is the means by which you\ntry to make your <em>sleeping</em> dreams <em>come true</em>. From this you do not\nawaken. The special relationship] is your determination to keep your\nhold on unreality and to prevent yourself from waking. And while you see\nmore value in sleeping than in waking, you will not let go of it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> The Holy Spirit, ever practical in His wisdom, accepts your dreams\nand uses them as means for waking. <em>You</em> would have used them to remain\nasleep. We once said that the first change, before dreams disappear, is\nthat your dreams of fear are changed to happy dreams. That is what the\nHoly Spirit does in your special relationship. He does not destroy it\nnor snatch it away from you. [But He does use it differently, as a help\nto make <em>His</em> purpose <em>real</em> to you.] Your special relationship will\nremain, not as a source of pain and guilt, but as a source of joy and\nfreedom. It will not be for you alone, for therein lay its misery. As\nits unholiness kept it a thing apart, its holiness will become an\noffering to everyone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> Your special relationship will be a means for undoing guilt in\neveryone blessed through your holy relationship. It will be a happy\ndream, and one which you will share with all who come within your sight.\nThrough it, the blessing which the Holy Spirit has laid upon it will be\nextended. Think not that He has forgotten anyone in the purpose He has\ngiven you. And think not that He has forgotten you to whom He gave the\ngift. He uses everyone who calls on Him as means for the salvation of\neveryone. And He will waken everyone through you who offered your\nrelationship to Him. If you but recognized His gratitude! Or mine\nthrough His! For we are joined as in one purpose, being of one mind with\nHim.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> Let not the dream take hold to close your eyes. It is not strange\nthat dreams can make a world that is unreal. The <em>wish</em> to make it is\nincredible. Your relationship has become one in which the wish has been\nremoved because its purpose has been changed from one of dreams to one\nof truth. You are not sure of this because you think it may be <em>this</em>\nthat is the dream. You are so used to choosing between dreams you do not\nsee that you have made, at last, the choice between the truth and <em>all</em>\nillusions.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> Yet Heaven is sure. This is no dream. Its coming means that you have\nchosen truth, and it has come because you have been willing to let your\nspecial relationship meet its conditions. In your relationship, the Holy\nSpirit has gently laid the real world—the world of happy dreams from\nwhich awaking is so easy and so natural. For as your sleeping and your\nwaking dreams represent the same wishes in your mind, so do the real\nworld and the truth of Heaven join in the Will of God. The dream of\nwaking is easily transferred to its reality. For this dream comes from\nyour will joined with the Will of God. And what this will would have\naccomplished has never <em>not</em> been done.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>24</sup> You who have spent your lives in bringing truth to illusion, reality\nto fantasy, have walked the way of dreams. For you have gone from waking\nto sleeping and on and on to a yet deeper sleep. Each dream has led to\nother dreams, and every fantasy which seemed to bring a light into the\ndarkness but made the darkness deeper. Your <em>goal</em> was darkness in which\nno ray of light could enter. And you sought a blackness so complete that\nyou could hide from truth forever in complete insanity. What you forgot\nwas simply that God cannot destroy Himself. The light is <em>in</em> you.\nDarkness can cover it but <em>cannot</em> put it out.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> As the light comes nearer, you will rush to darkness, shrinking from\nthe truth, sometimes retreating to the lesser forms of fear and\nsometimes to stark terror. But you <em>will</em> advance because your goal <em>is</em>\nthe advance from fear to truth. You <em>know</em> this. The goal which you\naccepted <em>is</em> the goal of knowledge, for which you signified your\nwillingness. Fear seems to live in darkness, and when you are afraid,\nyou have stepped back. Let us then join quickly in an instant of light,\nand it will be enough to remind you that your goal <em>is</em> light. Truth has\nrushed to meet you since you called upon it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> If you knew Who walks beside you on this way which you have chosen,\nfear would be impossible. You do not know because the journey into\ndarkness has been long and cruel, and you have gone deep into it. A\nlittle flicker of your eyelids, closed so long, has not yet been\nsufficient to give you confidence in yourselves, so long despised. You\ngo toward love, still hating it and terribly afraid of its judgment upon\nyou. And you do not realize that you are not afraid of love, but only of\nwhat you have made of it. You are advancing to love’s meaning and away\nfrom all illusions in which you have surrounded it. When you retreat to\nthe illusion, your fear increases, for there is little doubt that what\nyou think it means <em>is</em> fearful. Yet what is that to us who travel\nsurely and very swiftly <em>away</em> from fear?</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> You who hold each other’s hand also hold mine, for when you joined\neach other you were not alone. Do you believe that I would leave you in\nthe darkness you agreed to leave with <em>me</em>? In your relationship is this\nworld’s light. And fear <em>must</em> disappear before you now. Be tempted not\nto snatch away the gift of faith you offered to each other. You will\nsucceed only in frightening yourselves. The gift is given forever, for\nGod Himself received it. You <em>cannot</em> take it back. You have accepted\nGod. The holiness of your relationship is established in Heaven. You do\nnot understand what you accepted, but remember that your understanding\nis not necessary. All that was necessary was merely the <em>wish</em> to\nunderstand. That wish was the desire to be holy. The Will of God is\ngranted you. For you desire the only thing you ever had or ever were.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> Each instant that we spend together will teach you that this goal is\npossible and will strengthen your desire to reach it. And in your desire\nlies its accomplishment. Your desire is now in complete accord with all\nthe power of the Holy Spirit’s will. No little, faltering footsteps that\nyou may take can separate your desire from His Will and from His\nstrength. I hold your hand as surely as you agreed to take each other’s.\nYou will not separate, for I stand with you and walk with you in your\nadvance to truth. And where we go, we carry God with us.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> In your relationship, you have joined with me in bringing Heaven to\nthe Son of God, who hid in darkness. You have been willing to bring the\ndarkness to light, and this willingness has given strength to everyone\nwho would remain in darkness. Those who would see <em>will</em> see. And they\nwill join with me in carrying their light into the darkness when the\ndarkness in them is offered to the light and is removed forever. My need\nfor you, joined with me in the holy light of your relationship, is\n<em>your</em> need for salvation. Would I not give you what you gave to me? For\nwhen you joined each other, you answered me.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> You who are now the bringers of salvation have the function of\nbringing light to darkness. The darkness in you <em>has</em> been brought to\nlight. Carry it back to darkness from the holy instant to which you\nbrought it. We are made whole in our desire to make whole. Let not time\nworry you, for all the fear that you experience is really past. Time has\nbeen readjusted to help us do together what your separate pasts would\nhinder. You have gone past fear, for no two minds can join in the desire\nfor love without love’s joining <em>them</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> Not one light in Heaven but goes with you. Not one ray that shines\nforever in the Mind of God but shines on you. Heaven is joined with you\nin your advance to Heaven. When such great light has joined with you to\ngive the little spark of your desire the power of God Himself, <em>can</em> you\nremain in darkness? You are coming home together after a long and\nmeaningless journey which you undertook apart and which led nowhere. You\nhave found each other and will light each other’s way. And from this\nlight will the Great Rays extend back into darkness and forward unto God\nto shine away the past and so make room for His eternal Presence, in\nwhich everything is radiant in the light.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>32</sup> The holy instant is the result of your determination to be holy. It\nis the <em>answer</em>. The desire and the willingness to let it come precedes\nits coming. You prepare your minds for it only to the extent of\nrecognizing that you want it above all else. It is not necessary that\nyou do more; indeed, it is necessary that you realize that you <em>cannot</em>\ndo more. Do not attempt to give the Holy Spirit what He does not ask, or\nyou will add the ego unto Him and confuse the two. He asks but little.\nIt is <em>He</em> who adds the greatness and the might. He joins with you to\nmake the holy instant far greater than you can understand. It is your\nrealization that you need do so little that enables Him to give so much.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> Trust not your good intentions. They are not enough. But trust\nimplicitly your willingness, whatever else may enter. Concentrate only\non this and be not disturbed that shadows surround it. That is why you\ncame. If you could come without them, you would not <em>need</em> the holy\ninstant. Come to it not in arrogance, assuming that you must achieve the\nstate its coming brings with it. The miracle of the holy instant lies in\nyour willingness to let it be what it is. And in your willingness for\nthis lies also your acceptance of yourself as <em>you</em> were meant to be.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> Humility will never ask that you remain content with littleness. But\nit <em>does</em> require that you be <em>not</em> content with less than greatness,\nwhich comes not of you. Your difficulty with the holy instant arises\nfrom your fixed conviction that you are not worthy of it. And what is\nthis but the determination to be as you would <em>make</em> yourself? God did\nnot create His dwelling-place unworthy of Him. And if you believe He\ncannot enter where He wills to be, you must be <em>interfering</em> with His\nWill. You do not need the strength of willingness to come from <em>you</em>,\nbut only from <em>His</em> Will.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> The holy instant does not come from your little willingness alone. It\nis always the result of your small willingness combined with the\nunlimited power of God’s Will. You have been wrong in thinking that it\nis needful to <em>prepare</em> yourself for Him. It is impossible to make\narrogant preparations for holiness and <em>not</em> believe that it is up to\nyou to establish the conditions for peace. <em>God</em> has established them.\nThey do not wait upon your willingness for what they are. Your\nwillingness is needed only to make it possible to <em>teach</em> you what they\nare. If you maintain you are unworthy of learning this, you are\ninterfering with the lesson by believing that you make the <em>learner</em>\ndifferent. You did not make the learner, nor <em>can</em> you make him\ndifferent. Would you first make a miracle yourself and then expect one\nto be made <em>for</em> you?</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> <em>You</em> merely ask the question. The answer is <em>given</em>. Seek not to\nanswer it, but merely <em>receive</em> the answer as it is given. In preparing\nfor the holy instant, do not attempt to make yourself holy to be ready\nto receive it. That is but to confuse your role with God’s. Atonement\ncannot come to those who think that <em>they</em> must first atone, but only to\nthose who offer it nothing more than simple willingness to make way for\nit. Purification is of God alone and therefore for you. Rather than seek\nto prepare yourself for Him, try to think thus:</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> <em>I who am host to God <strong>am</strong><br /> worthy of Him.<br />\nHe Who established His dwelling-place in me created it<br />\nas He would have it be.<br />\nIt is not needful that I make it ready for Him,<br />\nBut only that I do not interfere with His plan to restore to<br />\nme my own awareness of my readiness, which is eternal.<br />\nI need add nothing to His plan.<br />\nBut to receive it, I must be willing not to substitute my own in place of it</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> And that is all. Add more and you will merely <em>take away</em> the little\nthat is asked. Remember you made guilt and that your plan for the\nescape from guilt has been to bring Atonement <em>to</em> it and make salvation\nfearful. And it is only fear that you will add if you prepare <em>yourself</em>\nfor love. The preparation for the holy instant belongs to Him Who gives\nit. Release yourselves to Him Whose function is release. Do not assume\nHis function for Him. Give Him but what He asks, that you may learn how\nlittle is your part and how great is His.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> It is this that makes the holy instant so easy and so natural. You\nmake it difficult because you insist there must be more that you need\ndo. [You find it difficult to <em>accept</em> the idea that you need give so\n<em>little</em> to receive so much.] And it is very hard for you to realize\nthat it is not personally insulting that your contribution and the Holy\nSpirit’s are so extremely disproportionate. You are still convinced\n<em>your</em> understanding is a powerful contribution to the truth and makes\nit what it is. Yet we have emphasized that you need understand nothing.\nSalvation is easy just <em>because</em> it asks nothing that you cannot give\n<em>right now</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> Forget not that it has been your decision to make everything that\n<em>is</em> natural and easy for you impossible. What you believe to be\nimpossible will <em>be</em> if God so wills it, but you will remain quite\nunaware of it. If you believe the holy instant is difficult for you, it\nis because you have become the arbiter of what is possible and remain\nunwilling to give place to One Who <em>knows</em>. The whole belief in orders\nof difficulty in miracles is centered on this. Everything God wills is\nnot only possible but has already <em>happened</em>. And that is why the past\nhas gone. It <em>never</em> happened in reality. Only in your minds, which\nthought it did, is its undoing needful.</p>\n\n",

Their message is,\n“Thy will be done,” and not, “I want it otherwise.” The alignment of\nmeans and purpose is an undertaking impossible for you to understand.\nYou do not even realize you <em>have</em> accepted the Holy Spirit’s purpose as\nyour own, and you would merely bring unholy means to its accomplishment.\nThe little faith it needed to change the purpose is all that is required\nto receive the means and <em>use</em> them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> It is no dream to love your brother as yourself. Nor is your holy\nrelationship a dream. All that remains of dreams within it is that it is\nstill a <em>special</em> relationship. Yet it is very useful to the Holy\nSpirit, Who <em>has</em> a special function here. It will become the happy\ndream through which He can spread joy to thousands on thousands who\nbelieve that love is fear, not happiness. Let Him fulfill the function\nthat He gave to your relationship by accepting it <em>for</em> you, and nothing\nwill be wanting that would make of it what He would have it be.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> When you feel the holiness of your relationship is threatened by\nanything, stop instantly and offer the Holy Spirit your willingness <em>in\nspite</em> of fear to let Him exchange this instant for the holy one which\nyou would rather have. He will never fail in this. But forget not that\nyour relationship is one, and so it must be that whatever threatens the\npeace of one is an equal threat to the other. The power of joining and\nits blessing lie in the fact that it is now impossible for either of you\nto experience fear alone or to attempt to deal with it alone. Never\nbelieve that this is necessary or even possible. Yet just as this is\nimpossible, so is it equally impossible that the holy instant come to\neither of you <em>without</em> the other. And it will come to <em>both</em> at the\nrequest of either.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> Whichever is saner at the time when the threat is perceived should\nremember how deep is his indebtedness to the other and how much\ngratitude is due him and be glad that he can pay his debt by bringing\nhappiness to both. Let him remember this, and say:</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> <em>I desire this holy instant for myself<br />\nThat I may share it with my brother, whom I love.<br />\nIt is not possible that I can have it without him, or he without me.<br />\nYet it is wholly possible for us to share it <strong>now</strong>.<br />\nAnd so I choose this instant as the one to offer to the Holy Spirit,<br />\nThat His blessing may descend on us and keep us <strong>both</strong> in peace</em>.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>49</sup> There is <em>nothing</em> outside you. That is what you must ultimately\nlearn, for it is [in that] realization that the Kingdom of Heaven is\nrestored to you. For God created only this, and He did not depart from\nit nor leave it separate from Himself. The Kingdom of Heaven is the\ndwelling-place of the Son of God, who left not his Father and dwells not\napart from Him. Heaven is not a place nor a condition. It is merely an\nawareness of perfect Oneness and the knowledge that there is nothing\nelse; nothing outside this Oneness and nothing else within.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> What could God give but knowledge of Himself? What else <em>is</em> there to\ngive? The belief that you could give and <em>get</em> something else, something\n<em>outside</em> yourself, has cost you the awareness of Heaven and the loss of\nyour Identity. And you have done a stranger thing than you yet realize.\nYou have displaced your guilt to your bodies from your minds. Yet a body\n<em>cannot</em> be guilty, for it can do nothing of itself. You who think you\nhate your bodies deceive yourselves. You hate your <em>minds</em>, for guilt\nhas entered into them, and they would remain separate, which they cannot\ndo.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> Minds <em>are</em> joined; bodies are not. Only by assigning to the mind the\nproperties of the body does separation seem to be possible. And it is\n<em>mind</em> that seems to be fragmented and private and alone. Its guilt,\nwhich <em>keeps</em> it separate, is projected to the body, which suffers and\ndies because it is attacked, to hold the separation in the mind and let\nit <em>not know</em> its identity. Mind cannot attack, but it <em>can</em> make\nfantasies and direct the body to act them out. Yet it is never what the\nbody does that seems to satisfy. Unless the mind believes the body is\nactually acting out its fantasies, it will attack the body by increasing\nthe projection of its guilt upon it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> In this, the mind is clearly delusional. It cannot attack, but it\nmaintains it <em>can</em> and uses what it does to hurt the body to <em>prove</em> it\ncan. The mind cannot attack, but it <em>can</em> deceive itself. And this is\nall it does when it believes it has attacked the body. It can project\nits guilt, but it will not <em>lose</em> it through projection. And though it\nclearly can misperceive the function of the body, it cannot change its\nfunction from what the Holy Spirit establishes it to be. The body was\nnot made by love. Yet love does not condemn it and can use it lovingly,\nrespecting what the Son of God has made and using it to save him from\nillusions.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> Would you not have the instruments of separation reinterpreted as\nmeans for salvation and used for purposes of love? Would you not welcome\nand support the shift from fantasies of vengeance to release from them?\nYour perception of the body can clearly be sick, but project not this\nupon the body. For your wish to make destructive what cannot destroy can\nhave no real effect at all. And what God created is only what He would\nhave it be, being His Will. You <em>cannot</em> make His Will destructive. You\ncan make fantasies in which your will conflicts with His, but that is\nall.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> It is insane to use the body as the scapegoat for guilt, directing\nits attack and blaming it for what you wished it to do. It is\n<em>impossible</em> to act out fantasies. For it is still the <em>fantasies</em> you\nwant, and they have nothing to do with what the body does. <em>It</em> does not\ndream of them, and they but make it a liability where it could be an\nasset. For fantasies have made your body your “enemy,” weak, vulnerable,\nand treacherous, worthy of the hate which you invest in it. How has this\nserved you? You have <em>identified</em> with this thing you hate, the\ninstrument of vengeance and the perceived source of your guilt. You have\ndone this to a thing that has no meaning, proclaiming it to be the\ndwelling-place of the Son of God and turning it against him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> This is the host of God that <em>you</em> have made. And neither God nor His\nmost holy Son can enter an abode which harbors hate and where you have\nsown the seeds of vengeance, violence, and death. This thing you made to\nserve your guilt stands between you and other minds. The minds <em>are</em>\njoined, but you do not identify with them. You see yourself locked in a\nseparate prison, removed and unreachable, incapable of reaching out as\nbeing reached. You hate this prison you have made and would destroy it.\nBut you would not escape from it, leaving it unharmed, without your\nguilt upon it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Yet only thus <em>can</em> you escape. The home of vengeance is not yours;\nthe place you set aside to house your hate is not a prison but an\nillusion of <em>yourself</em>. The body is a limit imposed on the universal\ncommunication which is an eternal property of mind. But the\ncommunication is <em>internal</em>. [It is <em>not</em> made up of different <em>parts</em>\nwhich reach each other.] Mind reaches to <em>itself</em>. It does not go\n<em>out</em>. Within itself it has no limits, and there is nothing outside it.\n[It encompasses <em>everything</em>.] It encompasses you entirely; you within\nit, and it within you. There is nothing else, anywhere or ever.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> The body is outside you, and but <em>seems</em> to surround you, shutting\nyou off from others and keeping you apart from them [and them from\nyou]. It is not there. There <em>is</em> no barrier between God and His Son,\nnor can His Son be separated from himself except in illusions. This is\nnot his reality, though he believes it is. Yet this could only be if God\nwere wrong. God would have had to create differently and to have\nseparated Himself from His Son to make this possible. He would have had\nto create different things and to establish different <em>orders</em> of\nreality, only <em>some</em> of which were love. Yet love must be forever like\nitself, changeless forever and forever without alternative. And so it\nis. You cannot put a barrier around yourself because God placed none\nbetween Himself and you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> You can stretch out your hand and reach to Heaven. You whose hands\nare joined have begun to reach beyond the body, but <em>not</em> outside\nyourselves, to reach your shared Identity <em>together</em>. Could this be\n<em>outside</em> you? Where God is <em>not</em>? Is <em>He</em> a body, and did He create you\nas He is not and where He cannot be? You are surrounded only by <em>Him</em>.\nWhat limit can there be on you whom He encompasses? Everyone has\nexperienced what he would call a sense of being transported beyond\nhimself. This feeling of liberation far exceeds the dream of freedom\nsometimes experienced in special relationships. It is a sense of actual\n<em>escape</em> from limitations.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> If you will consider what this “transportation” really entails, you\nwill realize that it is a sudden unawareness of the body and a joining\nof yourself and something else in which your mind enlarges to encompass\nit. It becomes part of you as you unite with it. And both become whole\nas neither is perceived as separate. What really happens is that you\nhave given up the illusion of a limited awareness and lost your fear of\nunion. The love that instantly replaces it <em>extends</em> to what has freed\nyou and unites with it. And while this lasts, you are not uncertain of\nyour Identity and would not limit it. You have escaped from fear to\npeace, asking no questions of reality but merely accepting it. You have\naccepted this <em>instead</em> of the body and have let yourself be one with\nsomething beyond it simply by not letting your mind be <em>limited</em> by it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> This can occur regardless of the physical distance which seems to be\nbetween you and what you join, of your respective positions in space,\nand of your differences in size and seeming quality. Time is not\nrelevant; it can occur with something past, present, or anticipated. The\n“something” can be anything and anywhere—a sound, a sight, a thought, a\nmemory, and even a general idea without specific reference. Yet in every\ncase, you joined it without reservation because you love it and would be\nwith it. And so you rush to meet it, letting your limits melt away,\nsuspending all the “laws” your body obeys and gently setting them aside.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> There is no violence at all in this escape. The body is not attacked,\nbut simply properly <em>perceived</em>. It does not limit you merely because\nyou would not have it so. You are not really “lifted out” of it; it\ncannot <em>contain</em> you. You go where you would be, gaining, not losing, a\nsense of self. In these instants of release from physical restrictions,\nyou experience much of what happens in the holy instant; the lifting of\nthe barriers of time and space, the sudden experience of peace and joy,\nand, above all, the lack of awareness of the body and of the questioning\nwhether or not all this is possible.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> It is possible because you <em>want</em> it. The sudden expansion of the\nself which takes place with your desire for it is the irresistible\nappeal the holy instant holds. It calls to you to be yourself within its\nsafe embrace. There are the laws of limit lifted <em>for</em> you, to welcome\nyou to openness of mind and freedom. Come to this place of refuge, where\nyou can be yourself in peace. Not through destruction, not through a\n“breaking out,” but merely by a quiet “melting in.” For peace will join\nyou there simply because you have been willing to let go the limits you\nhave placed upon love and joined it where it is and where it led you in\nanswer to its gentle call to <em>be</em> at peace.</p>\n\n",

This makes it an end and not a means in your\ninterpretation, and this <em>always</em> means you still find sin attractive.\nNo one accepts Atonement for himself who still accepts sin as his goal.\nYou have thus not met your <em>one</em> responsibility. Atonement is not\nwelcomed by those who prefer pain and destruction.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> You have made much progress and are really trying to make still more,\nbut there is one thing you have never done—not for one instant have you\nutterly forgotten the body. It has faded at times from your sight, but\nit has not yet completely disappeared. You are not asked to let this\nhappen for more than an instant, yet it is in this instant that the\nmiracle of Atonement happens. Afterwards, you will see the body again,\nbut never quite the same. And every instant that you spend <em>without</em>\nawareness of it gives you a different view of it when you return.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> At no single instant does the body exist at all. It is always\nremembered or anticipated, but never experienced just <em>now</em>. Only its\npast and future make it seem real. Time controls it entirely, for sin is\nnever present. In any single instant, the attraction of guilt would be\nexperienced as pain and nothing else and would be avoided. It has no\nattraction <em>now</em>. Its whole attraction is imaginary and therefore <em>must</em>\nbe thought of in the past or in the future.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> It is impossible to accept the holy instant without reservation\nunless just for an instant you are willing to see <em>no</em> past or future.\nYou cannot prepare for it <em>without</em> placing it in the future. Release is\ngiven you the instant you desire it. Many have spent a lifetime in\npreparation and have indeed achieved their instants of success. This\ncourse does not attempt to teach more than they learned in time, but it\ndoes aim at <em>saving</em> time. You are attempting to follow a very long road\nto the goal you have accepted. It is extremely difficult to reach\nAtonement by fighting against sin. [Enormous effort is expended in the\nattempt to make holy what is hated and despised.] Nor is a lifetime of\ncontemplation and long periods of meditation aimed at detachment from\nthe body necessary. All such attempts will ultimately succeed because of\ntheir purpose. Yet the means are tedious and very time consuming, for\nall of them look to the <em>future</em> for release from a state of present\nunworthiness and inadequacy.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> Your way will be different, not in purpose but in means. A holy\nrelationship is a means of <em>saving time</em>. One instant spent <em>together</em>\nrestores the universe to <em>both</em> of you. You <em>are</em> prepared. Now you need\nbut to remember you need do <em>nothing</em>. It would be far more profitable\nnow merely to concentrate on this than to consider what you <em>should</em> do.\nWhen peace comes at last to those who wrestle with temptation and fight\nagainst the giving in to sin; when the light comes at last into the mind\ngiven to contemplation; or when the goal is finally achieved by anyone,\nit <em>always</em> comes with just one happy realization: “I need do nothing.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> Here is the ultimate release which everyone will one day find in his\nown way, at his own time. We do not need this time. Time has been saved\nfor you because you are together. This is the special means this course\nis using to save you time. You are not making use of the course if you\ninsist on using means which have served others well, neglecting what was\nmade for <em>you</em>. Save time for me by only this <em>one</em> preparation and\npractice, doing nothing else. “I need do nothing” is a statement of\nallegiance, a truly undivided loyalty. Believe it for just one instant,\nand you will accomplish more than is given to a century of contemplation\nor of struggle against temptation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> To <em>do</em> anything involves the body. And if you recognize you <em>need</em>\ndo nothing, you have withdrawn the body’s value from your mind. Here is\nthe quick and open door through which you slip past centuries of effort\nand escape from time. This is the way in which sin loses all attraction\n<em>right now</em>. For here is time denied and past and future gone. Who need\ndo nothing has no need for time. To do nothing is to rest and make a\nplace within you where the activity of the body ceases to demand\nattention. Into this place the Holy Spirit comes and there abides. He\nwill remain when you forget and the body’s activities return to occupy\nyour conscious mind.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> Yet there will always be this place of rest to which you can return.\nAnd you will be more aware of this quiet center of the storm than all\nits raging activity. This quiet center, in which you do nothing, will\nremain with you, giving you rest in the midst of every busy doing on\nwhich you are sent. For from this center will you be directed how to use\nthe body sinlessly. It is this center, from which the body is absent,\nthat will keep it so in your awareness of it.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>71</sup> It is only the awareness of the body that makes love seem limited.\nFor the body <em>is</em> a limit on love. The belief in limited love was its\norigin, and it was <em>made</em> to limit the unlimited. Think not that this is\nmerely allegorical, for it was made to limit <em>you</em>. Can you who see\nyourselves within a body know yourself as an <em>idea</em>? Everything you\nrecognize you identify with externals, something outside itself. You\ncannot even think of God without a body or some form you think you\nrecognize.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> The body cannot <em>know</em>. And while you limit your awareness to its\ntiny senses, you will not see the grandeur which surrounds you. God\ncannot come into a body, nor can you join Him there. Limits on love will\nalways seem to shut Him out and to keep you apart from Him. The body is\na tiny fence around a little part of a glorious and complete idea. It\ndraws a circle, infinitely small, around a very little segment of Heaven\nsplintered from the whole, proclaiming that within it is your kingdom,\nwhere God can enter not.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> Within this kingdom the ego rules, and cruelly. And to defend this\nlittle speck of dust, it bids you fight against the universe. This\nfragment of your mind is such a tiny part of it that, could you but\nappreciate the whole, you would see instantly that it is like the\nsmallest sunbeam to the sun or like the faintest ripple on the surface\nof the ocean. In its amazing arrogance, this tiny sunbeam has decided it\n<em>is</em> the sun; this almost imperceptible ripple hails itself as the\nocean. Think how alone and frightened is this little thought, this\ninfinitesimal illusion, holding itself apart against the universe. The\nsun becomes the sunbeam’s “enemy” which would devour it, and the ocean\nterrifies the little ripple and wants to swallow it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> Yet neither sun nor ocean is even aware of all this strange and\nmeaningless activity. They merely continue, unaware that they are feared\nand hated by a tiny segment of themselves. Even that segment is not lost\nto them, for it could not survive <em>apart</em> from them. And what it thinks\nit is in no way changes its total dependence on them for its being. Its\nwhole existence still remains in them. Without the sun the sunbeam would\nbe gone; the ripple without the ocean is inconceivable.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> Such is the strange position in which those in a world inhabited by\nbodies seem to be. Each body seems to house a separate mind, a\ndisconnected thought living alone and in no way joined to the Thought by\nwhich it was created. Each tiny fragment seems to be self-contained,\nneeding each other for some things but by no means totally dependent on\ntheir one Creator for everything and needing the whole to give them any\nmeaning, for by themselves they <em>do</em> mean nothing. Nor <em>have</em> they any\nlife apart and by themselves.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> Like to the sun and ocean your Self continues, unmindful that this\ntiny part regards itself <em>as</em> you. It is not missing; it could not exist\nif it were separate, nor would the whole be whole without it. It is not\na separate kingdom, ruled by an idea of separation from the rest. Nor\ndoes a fence surround it, preventing it from joining with the rest and\nkeeping it apart from its Creator. This little aspect is no different\nfrom the whole, being continuous with it and at one with it. It leads no\nseparate life because its life <em>is</em> the oneness in which its being was\ncreated.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> Do not accept this little fenced-off aspect as yourself. The sun and\nocean are as nothing beside what you are. The sunbeam sparkles only in\nthe sunlight, and the ripple dances as it rests upon the ocean. Yet in\nneither sun nor ocean is the power that rests in you. Would you remain\nwithin your tiny kingdom, a sorry king, a bitter ruler of all he surveys\nwho looks on nothing, yet who would still die to defend it? This little\nself is not your kingdom. Arched high above it and surrounding it with\nlove is the glorious whole, which offers all its happiness and deep\ncontent to every part. The little aspect which you think you set apart\nis no exception.</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> Love knows no bodies and reaches to everything created like itself.\nIts total lack of limit <em>is</em> its meaning. It is completely impartial in\nits giving, encompassing only to preserve and keep complete what it\nwould give. In your tiny kingdom, you have so little! Should it not,\nthen, be there that you would call on love to enter? Look at the desert,\ndry and unproductive, scorched and joyless, which makes up your little\nkingdom. And realize the life and joy which love would bring to it from\nwhere it comes and where it would return with you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> The Thought of God surrounds your little kingdom, waiting at the\nbarrier you built to come inside and shine upon the barren ground. See\nhow life springs up everywhere! The desert becomes a garden, green and\ndeep and quiet, offering rest to those who lost their way and wander in\nthe dust. Give them a place of refuge, prepared by love for them where\nonce a desert was. And everyone you welcome will bring love with him\nfrom Heaven for you. They enter one by one into this holy place, but\nthey will not depart as they had come, alone. The love they brought with\nthem will stay with them, as it will stay with <em>you</em>. And under its\nbeneficence, your little garden will expand and reach out to everyone\nwho thirsts for living water but has grown too weary to go on alone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> Go out and find them, for they bring your Self with them. And lead\nthem gently to your quiet garden and receive their blessing there. So\nwill it grow and stretch across the desert, leaving no lonely little\nkingdoms locked away from love and leaving <em>you</em> inside. And you will\nrecognize yourself and see your little garden gently transformed into\nthe Kingdom of Heaven with all the love of its Creator shining upon it.\nThe holy instant is your invitation to love, to enter into your bleak\nand joyless kingdom, and to transform it into a garden of peace and\nwelcome.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> Love’s answer is inevitable. It will come because you came without\nthe body and interposed no barriers which would interfere with its glad\ncoming. In the holy instant, you ask of love only what it offers\neveryone, neither less nor more. <em>Asking</em> for everything, you will\n<em>receive</em> it. And your shining Self will lift the tiny aspect which you\ntried to hide from Heaven straight <em>into</em> Heaven. No part of love calls\non the whole in vain. No Son of God remains outside His Fatherhood.</p>\n\n<p><sup>82</sup> Be sure of this—love has entered your special relationship and\nentered fully at your weak request. You do not recognize that love has\ncome because you have not yet let go of all the barriers you hold\nagainst each other. And you will not be able to give love welcome\nseparately. You could no more know God alone than He knows you without\nyour brother. But <em>together</em> you could no more be unaware of love than\nlove could know you not or fail to recognize itself in you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> You have reached the end of an ancient journey, not realizing yet\nthat it is over. You are still worn and tired and the desert’s dust\nstill seems to cloud your eyes and keep you sightless. Yet He Whom you\nwelcomed has come to you and would welcome <em>you</em>. He has waited long to\ngive you this. Receive it now of Him, for He would have you know Him.\nOnly a little wall of dust still stands between you. Blow on it lightly\nand with happy laughter, and it will fall away. And walk into the garden\nlove has prepared for <em>both</em> of you.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>84</sup> You have been told to bring the darkness to the light and guilt to\nholiness. And you have also been told that error must be corrected at\nits source. Therefore, it is the tiny part of yourself, the little\nthought that seems split off and separate, which the Holy Spirit needs.\nThe rest is fully in God’s keeping and <em>needs</em> no guide. Yet this wild\nand delusional thought needs help because in its delusions it thinks it\nis the Son of God, whole and omnipotent, sole ruler of the kingdom it\nset apart to tyrannize by madness into obedience and slavery.</p>\n\n<p><sup>85</sup> This is the little part of you, you think you stole from Heaven. Give\nit back to Heaven. Heaven has not lost it, but <em>you</em> have lost sight of\nHeaven. Let the Holy Spirit remove it from the withered kingdom in which\nyou set it off, surrounded by darkness, guarded by attack, and\nreinforced by hate. Within its barricades is still a tiny segment of the\nSon of God, complete and holy, serene and unaware of what you think\nsurrounds it. Be you not separate, for the One Who <em>does</em> surround it\nhas brought union to you, returning your little offering of darkness to\nthe eternal Light.</p>\n\n<p><sup>86</sup> How is this done? It is extremely simple, being based on what this\nlittle kingdom really is. The barren sands, the darkness and the\nlifelessness are seen only through the body’s eyes. Its vision <em>is</em>\ndistorted, and the messages it transmits to you who made it to <em>limit</em>\nyour awareness <em>are</em> little and limited and so fragmented they are\nmeaningless. From the world of bodies, made by insanity, insane messages\nseem to be returned to the mind which made it. And these messages bear\nwitness to this world, pronouncing it as true. For <em>you</em> sent forth\nthese messengers to bring this back to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> Everything these messages relay to you is quite external. There are\nno messages which speak of what lies underneath, for it is not the body\nthat <em>could</em> speak of this. Its eyes perceive it not; its senses remain\nquite unaware of it; its tongue cannot relay its messages. Yet God can\nbring you there if you are willing to follow the Holy Spirit through\nseeming terror, trusting Him not to abandon you and leave you there. For\nit is not His purpose to frighten you, but only <em>yours</em>. You are\nseverely tempted to abandon Him at the outside ring of fear, but He\nwould lead you safely through and far beyond.</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> The circle of fear lies just below the level the body sees and seems\nto be the whole foundation on which the world is based. Here are all the\nillusions, all the twisted thoughts, all the insane attacks, the fury,\nvengeance, and betrayal that were made to keep the guilt in place, so\nthat the world could rise from it and keep it hidden. Its shadow rises\nto the surface, enough to hold its most external manifestations in\ndarkness and to bring despair and loneliness to it and keep it joyless.\nYet its intensity is veiled by its heavy coverings and kept apart from\nwhat was made to keep it hidden. The body cannot see this, for the body\narose from this for its protection, which must always depend on keeping\nit <em>not</em> seen. The body’s eyes will never look on it. Yet they will see\nwhat it dictates.</p>\n\n<p><sup>89</sup> The body will remain guilt’s messenger and will act as it directs as\nlong as you believe that guilt is real. For the reality of guilt is the\nillusion which seems to make it heavy and opaque, impenetrable, and a\nreal foundation for the ego’s thought system. Its thinness and\ntransparency are not apparent until you see the light <em>behind</em> it. And\nthen you see it as a fragile veil before the light.</p>\n\n<p><sup>90</sup> This heavy-seeming barrier, this artificial floor which looks like\nrock, is like a bank of low dark clouds that seems to be a solid wall\nbefore the sun. Its impenetrable appearance is wholly an illusion. It\ngives way softly to the mountain tops which rise above it and has no\npower at all to hold back anyone willing to climb above it and see the\nsun. It is not strong enough to stop a button’s fall nor hold a feather.\n[Nothing can rest upon it, for it is but an <em>illusion</em> of a\nfoundation.] Try but to touch it and it disappears; attempt to grasp it\nand your hands hold nothing.</p>\n\n<p><sup>91</sup> Yet in this cloud bank, it is easy to see a whole world rising. A\nsolid mountain range, a lake, a city, all rise in your imagination, and\nfrom the clouds the messengers of your perception return to you,\nassuring you that it is all there. Figures stand out and move about,\nactions seem real, and forms appear and shift from loveliness to the\ngrotesque. And back and forth they go, as long as you would play the\ngame of children’s make-believe. Yet however long you play it, and\nregardless of how much imagination you bring to it, you do not confuse\nit with the world below, nor seek to make it real.</p>\n\n<p><sup>92</sup> So should it be with the dark clouds of guilt, no more impenetrable\nand no more substantial. You will not bruise yourself against them in\ntraveling through. Let your Guide <em>teach</em> you their unsubstantial nature\nas He leads you past them, for beneath them is a world of light whereon\nthey cast no shadows. Their shadows lie upon the world beyond them,\nstill further from the light. Yet from them <em>to</em> the light their shadows\ncannot fall.</p>\n\n<p><sup>93</sup> This world of light, this circle of brightness, is the real world\nwhere guilt meets with forgiveness. Here the world outside is seen anew,\nwithout the shadow of guilt upon it. Here are you forgiven, for here you\nhave forgiven everyone. Here is the new perception, where everything is\nbright and shining with innocence, washed in the waters of forgiveness,\nand cleansed of every evil thought you had laid upon it. Here there is\nno attack upon the Son of God, and you are welcome. Here is your\ninnocence, waiting to clothe you and protect you and make you ready for\nthe final step in the journey inward. Here are the dark and heavy\ngarments of guilt laid by and gently replaced by purity and love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>94</sup> Yet even forgiveness is not the end. Forgiveness <em>does</em> make lovely,\nbut it does not create. It is the source of healing, but it is the\nmessenger of love and not its Source. Here you are led that God Himself\ncan take the final step unhindered, for here does nothing interfere with\nlove, letting it be itself. A step beyond this holy place [of\nforgiveness], a step still further inward but the one <em>you</em> cannot\ntake, transports you to something completely different. Here is the\nSource of light—nothing perceived, forgiven, nor transformed, but merely\n<em>known</em>.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>3</sup> The body cannot heal because it cannot make itself sick. It <em>needs</em> no\nhealing. Its health or sickness depends entirely on how the mind\nperceives it and the purpose which the mind would use it <em>for</em>. And it\nis obvious that a segment of the mind <em>can</em> see itself as separated from\nthe Universal Purpose. When this occurs, the body becomes its weapon\nused <em>against</em> this Purpose to demonstrate the “fact” that separation\nhas occurred. The body thus becomes the instrument of illusion, acting\naccordingly; seeing what is not there, hearing what truth has never\nsaid, and behaving insanely, being imprisoned <em>by</em> insanity.</p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup> Do not overlook our earlier statement that faithlessness leads\nstraight to illusions. For faithlessness is the perception of a brother\n<em>as</em> a body, and the body cannot be used for purposes of union. If,\nthen, you see your brother as a body, you have established a condition\nin which uniting with him becomes impossible. Your faithlessness to him\nhas separated you from him and kept you <em>both</em> apart from being healed.\nYour faithlessness has thus opposed the Holy Spirit’s purpose and\nbrought illusions centered on the <em>body</em> to stand between you. And the\nbody <em>will</em> seem to be sick, for you have made of it an “enemy” of\nhealing and the opposite of truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> It cannot be difficult to realize that faith must be the opposite of\nfaithlessness. Yet the difference in how they operate is less apparent,\nthough it follows directly from the fundamental difference in what they\nare. Faithlessness would always limit and attack; faith would remove all\nlimitations and make whole. [Faithlessness would destroy and\n<em>separate</em>; faith would unite and <em>heal</em>.] Faithlessness would\ninterpose illusions between the Son of God and his Creator; faith would\nremove all obstacles that seem to rise between them. Faithlessness is\nwholly dedicated to illusions; faith wholly to truth. Partial dedication\nis impossible. Truth is the <em>absence</em> of illusion; illusion the\n<em>absence</em> of truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> Both cannot <em>be</em> together nor perceived in the same place. To dedicate\nyourself to both is to set up a goal forever impossible to attain, for\npart of it is sought through the body, thought of as a means for seeking\nout reality through attack, while the other part would heal and\ntherefore calls upon the mind and <em>not</em> the body. The inevitable\ncompromise is the belief that the <em>body</em> must be healed, and <em>not</em> the\nmind. For this divided goal has given both an equal reality, which could\nbe possible only if the mind is limited to the body and divided into\nlittle parts of seeming wholeness but without connection. This will not\nharm the body, but it <em>will</em> keep the delusional thought system in the\n<em>mind</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> Here then is healing needed. And it is here that healing <em>is</em>. For God\ngave healing not <em>apart</em> from sickness, nor established remedy where\nsickness cannot be. They are <em>together</em>, and when they are <em>seen</em>\ntogether, all attempts to keep both truth and illusion in the mind,\nwhere both <em>must</em> be, are recognized as dedication to <em>illusion</em> and\ngiven up when brought to truth and seen as totally irreconcilable with\ntruth in any respect or in any way.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> Truth and illusion have <em>no</em> connection. This will remain forever\ntrue, however much you seek to connect them. But illusions are <em>always</em>\nconnected, as is truth. Each is united, a complete thought system, but\ntotally disconnected to each other. Where there is no overlap, there\nseparation must be complete. And to perceive this is to recognize where\nseparation <em>is</em> and where it must be healed. The result of an idea is\nnever separate from its source. The <em>idea</em> of separation produced the\nbody and remains connected to it, making it sick because of its\nidentification with it. You think you are protecting the body by hiding\nthis connection, for this concealment seems to keep your identification\nsafe from the “attack” of truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> If you but understood how much this strange concealment has hurt your\nmind and how confused your own identification has become because of it!\nYou do not see how great [is] the devastation wrought by your\nfaithlessness. For faithlessness is an attack which seems to be\njustified by its <em>results.</em> For by withholding faith, you see what <em>is</em>\nunworthy of it and cannot look beyond the barrier to what is joined with\nyou.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> To have faith is to heal. It is the sign that you have accepted the\nAtonement for yourself and would therefore share it. By faith you offer\nthe gift of freedom from the past, which <em>you</em> received. You do not use\nanything your brother has done before to condemn him <em>now</em>. You freely\nchoose to overlook his errors, looking past all barriers between your\nself and his and seeing them as one. And in that one you see your faith\nis fully justified. There <em>is</em> no justification for faithlessness, but\nfaith is <em>always</em> justified.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> Faith is the opposite of fear, as much a part of love as fear is of\nattack. Faith is the acknowledgment of union. It is the gracious\nacknowledgment of everyone as a Son of your most loving Father, loved by\nHim like you and therefore loved by you as yourself. It is His love that\njoins you, and for His love you would keep no one separate from <em>yours</em>.\nEach one appears just as he is perceived in the holy instant, united in\nyour purpose to be released from guilt. You saw the Christ in him, and\nhe was healed because you looked on what makes faith forever justified\nin everyone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> Faith is the gift of God, through Him Whom God has given you.\nFaithlessness looks upon the Son of God and judges him unworthy of\nforgiveness. But through the eyes of faith, the Son of God is seen\n<em>already</em> forgiven, free of all the guilt he laid upon himself. Faith\nsees him only <em>now</em> because it looks not to the past to judge him, but\nwould see in him only what it would see in <em>you</em>. It sees not through\nthe body’s eyes nor looks to bodies for its justification. It is the\nmessenger of the new perception sent forth to gather witnesses unto its\ncoming and to return their messages to you. Faith is as easily exchanged\nfor knowledge as is the real world. For faith arises from the Holy\nSpirit’s perception and is the sign you share it with Him. Faith is a\ngift you offer to the Son of God through Him, and wholly acceptable to\nhis Father as to him. And therefore offered <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> Your holy relationship, with its new purpose, offers you faith to\ngive unto each other. Your faithlessness had driven you apart, and so\nyou did not recognize salvation in each other. Yet faith <em>unites</em> you in\nthe holiness you see, not through the body’s eyes but in the sight of\nHim Who joined you and in Whom <em>you</em> are united. Grace is not given to a\nbody, but to a <em>mind</em>. And the mind that receives it looks instantly\nbeyond the body and sees the holy place where it was healed. <em>There</em> is\nthe altar where the grace was given, in which it stands. Do you, then,\noffer grace and blessing to each other, for you stand at the same altar\nwhere grace was laid for <em>both</em> of you. And be you healed by grace\ntogether, that <em>you</em> may heal through faith.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> In the holy instant, you stand before the altar God has raised unto\nHimself and <em>both</em> of you. Lay faithlessness aside and come to it\ntogether. There will you see the miracle of your relationship as it was\nmade again through faith. And there it is that you will realize that\nthere is nothing faith cannot forgive. No error interferes with its calm\nsight, which brings the miracle of healing with equal ease to <em>all</em> of\nthem. For what the messengers of love are sent to do <em>they do</em>,\nreturning the glad tidings that it was done to you who stand together\nbefore the altar from which they were sent forth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> As faithlessness will keep your little kingdoms barren and separate,\nso will faith help the Holy Spirit prepare the ground for the most holy\ngarden which He would make of it. For faith brings peace, and so it\ncalls on truth to enter and make lovely what has already been prepared\nfor loveliness. Truth follows faith and peace, completing the process of\nmaking lovely which they begin. For faith is still a learning goal, no\nlonger needed when the lesson has been learned. Yet truth will stay\nforever.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> Let then your dedication be to the eternal and learn how <em>not</em> to\ninterfere with it and make it slave to time. For what you think you do\nto the eternal you do to <em>you</em>. Whom God created as His Son is slave to\nnothing, being lord of all along with his Creator. You can enslave a\nbody, but an <em>idea</em> is free, incapable of being kept in prison or\nlimited in any way except by the mind that thought it. For it remains\njoined to its source, which is its jailor or its liberator, according to\nwhich it chooses as its purpose for itself.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>17</sup> It is essential that error be not confused with “sin,” and it is this\ndistinction which makes salvation possible. For error can be corrected,\nand the wrong made right. But sin, were it possible, would be\nirreversible. The belief in sin is necessarily based on the firm\nconviction that <em>minds</em>, not bodies, can attack. And thus the mind <em>is</em>\nguilty and will forever so remain unless a mind not part of it can give\nit absolution. Sin calls for punishment as error for correction, and the\nbelief that punishment <em>is</em> correction is clearly insane.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> Sin is not an error, for sin entails an arrogance which the idea of\nerror lacks. To sin would be to violate reality and to <em>succeed</em>. Sin is\nthe proclamation that attack is real and guilt is justified. It assumes\nthe Son of God is guilty and has thus succeeded in losing his innocence\nand making himself what God created not. Thus is creation seen as not\neternal, and the Will of God open to opposition and defeat. Sin is the\n“grand illusion” underlying all the ego’s grandiosity. For by it, God\nHimself is changed and rendered incomplete.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> The Son of God can be mistaken; he can deceive himself; he can even\nturn the power of his mind against himself. But he <em>cannot</em> sin. There\nis nothing he can do that would <em>really</em> change his reality in any way\nnor make him really guilty. That is what sin would do, for such is its\npurpose. Yet for all the wild insanity inherent in the whole idea of\nsin, it is <em>impossible</em>. For the wages of sin <em>is</em> death, and how can\nthe immortal die?</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> A major tenet in the ego’s insane religion is that sin is not error\nbut <em>truth</em>, and it is <em>innocence</em> that would deceive. Purity is seen as\narrogance, and the acceptance of the self as sinful is perceived as\nholiness. And it is this doctrine which replaces the reality of the Son\nof God as his Father created him and willed that he be forever. Is this\nhumility? Or is it, rather, an attempt to wrest creation <em>away</em> from\ntruth and keep it separate?</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> Any attempt to reinterpret sin as error is always indefensible to the\nego. The idea of sin is wholly sacrosanct to its thought system and\nquite unapproachable except through reverence and awe. It is the most\n“holy” concept in the ego’s system—lovely and powerful, wholly true, and\nnecessarily protected with every defense at its disposal. For here lies\nits “best” defense which all the others serve. Here is its armor, its\nprotection, and the fundamental purpose of the special relationship in\nits interpretation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> It can indeed be said the ego made its world on sin. Only in such a\nworld could everything be upside-down. This is the strange illusion\nwhich makes the clouds of guilt seem heavy and impenetrable. The\nsolidness this world’s foundation seems to have is found in this. For\nsin has changed creation from an idea of God to an ideal the ego wants;\na world <em>it</em> rules, made up of bodies, mindless and capable of complete\ncorruption and decay. If this is a mistake, it can be undone easily by\ntruth. Any mistake can be corrected, if truth be left to judge it. But\nif the mistake is given the <em>status</em> of truth, to what can it be\nbrought? The “holiness” of sin is kept in place by just this strange\ndevice. As truth it is inviolate, and everything is brought to <em>it</em> for\njudgment. As a mistake, <em>it</em> must be brought to truth. It is impossible\nto have faith in sin, for sin <em>is</em> faithlessness. Yet it <em>is</em> possible\nto have faith that a mistake can be corrected.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> There is no stone in all the ego’s embattled citadel more heavily\ndefended than the idea that sin is real—the natural expression of what\nthe Son of God has made himself to be and what he <em>is</em>. To the ego, this\nis <em>no mistake</em>. For this <em>is</em> its reality; this is the “truth” from\nwhich escape will always be impossible. This is his past, his present,\nand his future. For he has somehow managed to corrupt his Father and\nchanged His Mind completely. Mourn, then, the death of God, Whom sin has\nkilled! And this would be the ego’s wish, which in its madness it thinks\nit has <em>accomplished</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> Would you not <em>rather</em> that all this be nothing more than a mistake,\nentirely correctable, and so easily escaped from that its whole\ncorrection is like walking through a mist into the sun? For that is all\nit is. Perhaps you would be tempted to agree with the ego that it is far\nbetter to be sinful than mistaken. Yet think you carefully before you\nallow yourself to make this choice. Approach it not lightly, for it <em>is</em>\nthe choice of hell or Heaven.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>25</sup> The attraction of guilt is found in sin, not error. Sin will be\nrepeated <em>because</em> of this attraction. Fear can become so acute that the\nsin is denied the acting out, but while the guilt remains attractive the\nmind will suffer and not let go of the idea of sin. For guilt still\ncalls to it, and the mind hears it and yearns for it, making itself a\nwilling captive to its sick appeal. Sin is an idea of evil that <em>cannot</em>\nbe corrected and will be forever desirable. As an essential part of what\nthe ego thinks you are, you will <em>always</em> want it. And only an avenger\nwith a mind unlike your own could stamp it out through fear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> The ego does not think it possible that love, not fear, is really\ncalled upon by sin and always <em>answers</em>. For the ego brings sin to\n<em>fear</em>, demanding punishment. Yet punishment is but another form of\nguilt’s protection, for what is deserving punishment must have been\nreally <em>done</em>. Punishment is always the great preserver of sin, treating\nit with respect and honoring its enormity. [What must be punished <em>must\nbe true</em>. And what is true <em>must</em> be eternal and <em>will</em> be repeated\nendlessly.] For what you think is real you <em>want</em> and will not let it\ngo. An error, on the other hand, is not attractive. What you see clearly\nas a mistake you <em>want</em> corrected.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> Sometimes a sin can be repeated over and over with obviously\ndistressing results but without the loss of its appeal. And suddenly you\nchange its status from a sin to a mistake. Now you will not repeat it;\nyou will merely stop and let it go unless the guilt <em>remains</em>. For then\nyou will but change the <em>form</em> of sin, granting that it was an error but\nkeeping it uncorrectable. This is not really a change in your\nperception, for it is <em>sin</em> that calls for punishment, not error. The\nHoly Spirit <em>cannot</em> punish sin. Mistakes He recognizes and would\ncorrect them all as God entrusted Him to do. But sin He knows not, nor\ncan He recognize mistakes which cannot be corrected. For a mistake which\ncannot be corrected is meaningless to Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> Mistakes are <em>for</em> correction, and they call for nothing else. What\ncalls for punishment must call for nothing. Every mistake <em>must</em> be a\ncall for love. What, then, is sin? What could it be but a mistake you\nwould keep hidden—a call for help that you would keep unheard and thus\nunanswered? In time the Holy Spirit clearly sees the Son of God can make\nmistakes. On this you share His vision. Yet you do not share His\nrecognition of the difference between time and eternity. And when\ncorrection is completed, time <em>is</em> eternity.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> Time is like a downward spiral which seems to travel down from a\nlong, unbroken line along another plane but which in no way breaks the\nline or interferes with its smooth continuousness. Along the spiral, it\nseems as if the line must have been broken. Yet at the line, its\nwholeness is apparent. Everything seen from the spiral is misperceived,\nbut as you approach the line, you realize that it was not affected by\nthe drop into another plane at all. Yet from the plane, the line seems\ndiscontinuous. And this is but an error in perception which can be\neasily corrected in the <em>mind</em>, although the body’s eyes will see no\nchange. The eyes see many things the mind corrects, and you respond, not\nto the eyes’ illusions, but to the mind’s <em>corrections</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> You see the line as broken, and as you shift to different aspects of\nthe spiral, the line looks different. Yet in your mind is One Who knows\nit is unbroken and forever changeless. This One can teach you how to\nlook on time differently and see <em>beyond</em> it, but not while you believe\nin sin. In error, yes; for this can be corrected by the mind. But sin is\nthe belief that your perception is unchangeable and that the mind must\naccept as true what it is told through it. If it does not obey, the mind\nis judged insane. The only power which could change perception is thus\nkept impotent, held to the body by the <em>fear</em> of changed perception\nwhich its teacher, who is one with it, would bring.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> When you are tempted to believe that sin is real, remember this: If\nsin is real, both God and you are not. If creation is extension, the\nCreator must have extended Himself, and it is impossible that what is\npart of Him is totally unlike the rest. If sin is real, God must be at\nwar with Himself. He must be split and torn between good and evil—partly\nsane and partially insane. For He must have created what wills to\ndestroy Him and has the <em>power</em> to do so. Is it not easier to believe\nthat <em>you</em> have been mistaken than to believe in this?</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> While you believe that your reality or your brother’s is bounded by a\nbody, you will believe in sin. While you believe that bodies can unite,\nyou will find guilt attractive and believe that sin is precious. For the\nbelief that bodies limit mind leads to a perception of the world in\nwhich the proof of separation seems to be everywhere. And God and His\ncreation seem to be split apart and overthrown. For sin would <em>prove</em>\nwhat God created holy could not prevail against it nor remain itself\nbefore the power of sin. Sin is perceived as <em>mightier</em> than God, before\nwhich God Himself must bow and offer His creation to its conqueror. Is\nthis humility or madness?</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> If sin were real, it would forever be beyond the hope of healing. For\nthere would be a power beyond God’s, capable of making another will\nwhich could attack His Will and <em>overcome</em> it and give His Son a will\napart from His and <em>stronger</em>. And each part of God’s fragmented\ncreation would have a different will, opposed to His and in eternal\nopposition to Him and to each other. Your holy relationship has as its\npurpose now the goal of proving this is impossible. Heaven has smiled\nupon it, and the belief in sin has been uprooted in its smile of love.\nYou see it still because you do not realize that its <em>foundation</em> has\ngone. Its source has been removed, and so it can be cherished but a\nlittle while before it vanishes. Only the habit of <em>looking</em> for it\nstill remains.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> And yet you look with Heaven’s smile upon your lips and Heaven’s\nblessing on your sight. You will not see it long. For in the new\nperception, the mind corrects it when it seems to be seen, and it\nbecomes invisible. And errors are quickly recognized and quickly given\nto correction to be healed, not hidden. You will be healed of sin and\nall its ravages the instant that you give it no power over each other.\nAnd you will help each other overcome mistakes by joyously releasing one\nanother from the belief in sin.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> In the holy instant, you will see the smile of heaven shining on\n<em>both</em> of you. And you will shine upon each other in glad acknowledgment\nof the grace that has been given you. For sin will not prevail against a\nunion Heaven has smiled upon. Your perception was healed in the holy\ninstant Heaven gave you. Forget what you have seen and raise your eyes\nin faith to what you <em>now</em> can see. The barriers to heaven will\ndisappear before your holy sight, for you who were sightless have been\ngiven vision, and you can see. Look not for what has been removed but\nfor the glory that has been restored for you to see.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> Look upon your Redeemer and behold what He would show you in each\nother, and let not sin arise again to blind your eyes. For sin would\nkeep you separate, but your Redeemer would have you look upon each other\nas yourself. Your relationship is now a temple of healing—a place where\nall the weary ones can come and find rest. Here is the rest that waits\nfor all after the journey. And it is brought nearer to all by your\nrelationship.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> As this peace extends from deep inside yourselves to embrace all the\nSonship and give it rest, it will encounter many obstacles. Some of them\nyou will try to impose. Others will seem to arise from elsewhere—from\nyour brothers and from various aspects of the world outside. Yet peace\nwill gently cover them, extending past completely unhindered. The\nextension of the Holy Spirit’s purpose from your relationship to others\nto bring them gently in [has already begun. This is the way in which He\nwill bring means and goal in line. The peace He laid deep within <em>both</em>\nof you] will quietly extend to every aspect of your lives, surrounding\nboth of you with glowing happiness and the calm awareness of complete\nprotection. And you will carry its message of love and safety and\nfreedom to everyone who draws nigh unto your temple, where healing waits\nfor him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> You will not wait to give him this, for you will call to him and he\nwill answer you, recognizing in your call the Call of God. And you will\ndraw him in and give him rest, as it was given you. All this will you\ndo. Yet the peace which already lies deeply within must first expand and\nflow across the obstacles you placed before it. This will you do, for\nnothing undertaken with the Holy Spirit remains unfinished. You can\nindeed be sure of nothing you see outside you, but of this you <em>can</em> be\nsure: the Holy Spirit asks that you offer Him a resting-place where you\nwill rest in Him. He answered you and entered your relationship. Would\nyou not now return His graciousness and enter into a relationship with\nHim? For it is He Who offered your relationship the gift of holiness,\nwithout which it would have been forever impossible to appreciate each\nother.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> The gratitude you owe to Him He asks but that <em>you</em> receive for Him.\nAnd when you look with gentle graciousness upon each other, you <em>are</em>\nbeholding Him. For you are looking where He <em>is</em> and not apart from Him.\nYou cannot see the Holy Spirit, but you <em>can</em> see your brothers truly.\nAnd the light in them will show you all that you need to see. When the\npeace in you has been extended to encompass everyone, the Holy Spirit’s\nfunction here will be accomplished. What need is there for seeing then?\nWhen God has taken the last step Himself, the Holy Spirit will gather\nall your thanks and gratitude which you have offered Him and lay them\ngently before His Creator in the name of His most holy Son. And the\nFather will accept them in His Name. What need is there of seeing in the\npresence of His gratitude?</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<h2 id=\"a-the-first-obstacle-the-desire-to-get-rid-of-it\">a. The First Obstacle: The Desire to Get Rid of It</h2>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> The first obstacle that peace must flow across is your desire to get\n<em>rid</em> of it. For it cannot extend unless you <em>keep</em> it. You are the\ncenter from which it radiates outward to call the others in. You are its\nhome, its tranquil dwelling-place from which it gently reaches out but\nnever leaving <em>you</em>. If you would make it homeless, how can it abide\nwithin the Son of God? If it would spread across the whole creation, it\nmust begin with you and <em>from</em> you reach to everyone who calls and bring\nhim rest by joining you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> Why would you want peace homeless? What do you think that it must\ndispossess to dwell with you? What seems to be the cost you are so\nunwilling to pay? The little barrier of sand still stands between you.\nWould you reinforce it <em>now</em>? You are not asked to let it go for\nyourselves alone. Christ asks it of you for Himself. He would bring\npeace to everyone, and how can He do this <em>except</em> through you? Would\nyou let a little bank of sand, a wall of dust, a tiny seeming barrier,\nstand between your brothers and salvation? And yet, it <em>is</em> this little\nremnant of attack you cherish still against each other that is the first\nobstacle the peace in you encounters in its going forth. This little\nwall of hatred would still oppose the Will of God and keep it limited.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> The Holy Spirit’s purpose rests in peace within you. Yet you are\nstill unwilling to let it join you wholly. You still oppose the Will of\nGod, just by a little. And that little is a limit you would place upon\nthe whole. God’s Will is One, not many. It has no opposition, for there\nis none beside it. What you would still contain behind your little\nbarrier and keep separate from each other seems mightier than the\nuniverse, for it would hold back the universe and its Creator. This\nlittle wall would hide the purpose of Heaven and keep it <em>from</em> Heaven.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> Would you thrust salvation away from the <em>giver</em> of salvation? For\nsuch have you become. Peace could no more depart from you than from God.\nFear not this little obstacle. It cannot contain the Will of God. Peace\n<em>will</em> flow across it and join you without hindrance. Salvation cannot\n<em>be</em> withheld from you. It is your purpose. You <em>cannot</em> will apart from\nthis. You have no <em>purpose</em> apart from each other nor apart from the one\nyou asked the Holy Spirit to share with you. The little wall will fall\naway so quietly beneath the wings of peace! For peace will send its\nmessengers from you to all the world. And barriers will fall away before\ntheir coming as easily as those which you would interpose will be\nsurmounted.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> To overcome the world is no more difficult than to surmount your\nlittle wall. For in the miracle of your relationship, without this\nbarrier, is <em>every</em> miracle contained. There is no order of difficulty\nin miracles, for they are all the <em>same</em>. Each is a gentle winning over\nfrom the appeal of guilt to the appeal of love. How can this <em>fail</em> to\nbe accomplished, wherever it is undertaken? Guilt can raise no real\nbarriers against it. And all that seems to stand between you must fall\naway because of the appeal you answered. For from you who answered, He\nWho answered you would call. His home is in your holy relationship. Do\nnot attempt to stand between Him and His holy purpose, for it is yours.\nBut let Him quietly extend the miracle of your relationship to everyone\ncontained in it, as it was given.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> There is a hush in Heaven, a happy expectancy, a little pause of\ngladness in acknowledgment of the journey’s end. For Heaven knows you\nwell, as you know Heaven. No illusions stand between you now. Look not\nupon the little wall of shadows. The sun has risen <em>over</em> it. How can a\nshadow keep you from the sun? No more can you be kept by shadows from\nthe light in which illusions end. Every miracle is but the end of an\nillusion. Such was the journey; such its ending. And in the goal of\ntruth which you accepted must <em>all</em> illusions end.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> The little insane wish to get rid of Him Who you invited in and push\nHim out <em>must</em> produce conflict. As you look upon the world, this little\nwish, uprooted and floating aimlessly, can land and settle briefly upon\nanything, for it <em>has</em> no purpose now. Before the Holy Spirit entered to\nabide with you, it seemed to have a <em>mighty</em> purpose; the fixed and\nunchangeable dedication to sin and its results. Now it is aimless,\nwandering pointlessly, causing no more than tiny interruptions in love’s\nappeal.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> This feather of a wish, this tiny illusion, this microscopic remnant\nof the belief in sin, is all that remains of what once seemed to be the\nworld. It is no longer an unrelenting barrier to peace. Its pointless\nwandering makes its results appear to be more erratic and unpredictable\nthan before. Yet what <em>could</em> be more unstable than a tightly-organized\ndelusional system? Its seeming stability is its pervasive <em>weakness</em>,\nwhich extends to everything. The variability which the little remnant\ninduces merely indicates its limited results.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> How mighty can a little feather be before the great wings of truth?\nCan it oppose an eagle’s flight or hinder the advance of summer? Can it\ninterfere with the effects of summer’s sun upon a garden covered by the\nsnow? See but how easily this little wisp is lifted up and carried away,\nnever to return, and part with it in gladness, not regret. For it is\nnothing in itself and stood for nothing when you had greater faith in\nits protection. Would you not rather greet the summer sun than fix your\ngaze upon a disappearing snowflake and shiver in remembrance of the\nwinter’s cold?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-attraction-of-guilt\">The Attraction of Guilt</h2>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> The attraction of guilt produces fear of love, for love would never\nlook on guilt at all. It is the nature of love to look upon only the\ntruth, for there it sees itself, with which it would unite in holy union\nand completion. As love must look past fear, so must fear see love not.\nFor love contains the end of guilt as surely as fear depends on it.\n[Love is attracted <em>only</em> to love.] Overlooking guilt completely, it\nsees no fear. Being wholly without attack, it <em>could</em> not be afraid.\nFear is attracted to what love sees not, and each believes that what the\nother looks upon does not exist. Fear looks on guilt with just the same\ndevotion that love looks on itself. And each has messengers which they\nsend forth and which return to them with messages written in the\nlanguage in which their going forth was asked.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> Love’s messengers are gently sent and return with messages of love\nand gentleness. The messengers of fear are harshly ordered to seek out\nguilt and cherish every scrap of evil and of sin which they can find,\nlosing none of them on pain of death and laying them respectfully before\ntheir lord and master. Perception cannot obey two masters, each asking\nfor messages of different things in different languages. What fear would\nfeed upon, love overlooks. What fear demands, love cannot even see.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> The fierce attraction which guilt holds for fear is wholly absent\nfrom love’s gentle perception. What love would look upon is meaningless\nto fear and quite invisible. Relationships in this world are the result\nof how the world is seen. And this depends on which emotion was called\non to send its messengers to look upon it and return with word of what\nthey saw. Fear’s messengers are trained through terror, and they tremble\nwhen their master calls upon them to serve him. For fear is merciless\neven to its friends. Its messengers steal guiltily away in hungry search\nof guilt, for they are kept cold and starving and made very vicious by\ntheir master, who allows them to feast only upon what they return to\nhim. No little shred of guilt escapes their hungry eyes. And in their\nsavage search for sin, they pounce on any living thing they see and\ncarry it screaming to their master to be devoured.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> Send not these savage messengers into the world to feast upon it and\nto prey upon reality. For they will bring you word of bones and skin and\nflesh. They have been taught to seek for the corruptible and to return\nwith gorges filled with things decayed and rotted. To them such things\nare beautiful because they seem to allay their savage pangs of hunger.\nFor they are frantic with the pain of fear and would avert the\npunishment of him who sends them forth by offering him what they hold\ndear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> The Holy Spirit has given you love’s messengers to send instead of\nthose you trained through fear. They are as eager to return to you what\nthey hold dear as are the others. If you send them forth, they will see\nonly the blameless and the beautiful, the gentle and the kind. They will\nbe as careful to let no little act of charity, no tiny expression of\nforgiveness, no little breath of love escape their notice. And they will\nreturn with all the happy things they found, to share them lovingly with\nyou. Be not afraid of <em>them</em>. They offer you salvation. Theirs are the\nmessages of safety, for they see the world as kind.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> If you send forth only the messengers the Holy Spirit gives you,\n<em>wanting</em> no messages but theirs, you will see fear no more. The world\nwill be transformed before your sight, cleansed of all guilt and softly\nbrushed with beauty. The world contains no fear which you laid not upon\nit. And none you cannot ask love’s messengers to remove from it and see\nit still. The Holy Spirit has given you His messengers to send to each\nother and return to each with what love sees. They have been given to\nreplace the hungry dogs of fear you sent instead. And they go forth to\nsignify the <em>end</em> of fear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> Love, too, would set a feast before you on a table covered with a\nspotless cloth, set in a quiet garden where no sound but singing and a\nsoftly joyous whispering is ever heard. This is a feast which honors\nyour holy relationship and at which everyone is welcomed as an honored\nguest. And in a holy instant, grace is said by everyone together as they\njoin in gentleness before the table of communion. And I will join you\nthere, as long ago I promised and promise still. For in your new\nrelationship am I made welcome. And where I am made welcome, there <em>I\nam</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> I am made welcome in the state of grace, which means you have at last\nforgiven me. For I became the symbol of your sin, and so I had to die\ninstead of you. To the ego sin <em>means</em> death, and so Atonement is\nachieved through murder. Salvation is looked upon as a way by which the\nSon of God was killed instead of <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> Yet would I offer you my body, you whom I love, <em>knowing</em> its\nlittleness? Or would I teach that bodies cannot keep us apart? Mine was\nno greater value than yours; no better means for communication of\nsalvation, but <em>not</em> its Source. No one can die for anyone, and death\ndoes not atone for sin. Yet you can <em>live</em> to show it is not real. The\nbody <em>does</em> appear to be the symbol of sin while you believe that it can\nget you what you want. While you believe that it can give you pleasure,\nyou will also believe that it can bring you pain.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> To think you could be satisfied and happy with so little is to hurt\nyourself, and to limit the happiness that you would have calls upon pain\nto fill your meager store and make your lives complete. This <em>is</em>\ncompletion, as the ego sees it. For guilt creeps in where happiness has\nbeen removed and substitutes for it. Communion is another kind of\ncompletion which goes beyond guilt because it goes beyond the body.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"b-the-second-obstacle-the-belief-the-body-is-valuable-for-what-it-offers\">b. The Second Obstacle: The Belief the Body is Valuable for What it Offers</h2>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> We said that peace must first surmount the obstacle of your desire to\nget rid of it. Where the attraction of guilt holds sway, peace is not\n<em>wanted</em>. The second obstacle that peace must flow across, and closely\nrelated to the first, is the belief that the body is valuable for what\nit offers. For here is the attraction of guilt made manifest in the body\nand <em>seen</em> in it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> This [is] the value that you think peace would rob you of. This is\nwhat you believe that it would dispossess and leave you homeless. And it\nis this for which you would deny a home to peace. This “sacrifice” you\nfeel to be too great to make, too much to ask of you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> Is it a sacrifice or a release? What has the body really given you\nthat justifies your strange belief that in it lies salvation? Do you not\nsee that this is the belief in death? Here is the focus of the\nperception of Atonement as murder. Here is the source of the idea that\nlove is fear. The Holy Spirit’s messengers are sent far beyond the body,\ncalling the mind to join in holy communion and be at peace. Such is the\nmessage that I gave them for you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> It is only the messengers of fear that see the body, for they look\nfor what can suffer. Is it a sacrifice to be <em>removed</em> from what can\nsuffer? The Holy Spirit does not demand you sacrifice the hope of the\nbody’s pleasure; it <em>has</em> no hope of pleasure. But neither can it bring\nyou fear of pain. Pain is the only “sacrifice” the Holy Spirit asks, and\nthis He <em>would</em> remove.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> Peace is extended from you only to the eternal, and it reaches out\nfrom the eternal in <em>you</em>. It flows across all else. The second obstacle\nis no more solid than the first. For you will neither to get rid of\npeace <em>nor</em> limit it. What are these obstacles which you would interpose\nbetween peace and its going forth but barriers you place between your\nwill and its accomplishment? You <em>want</em> communion, not the feast of\nfear. You <em>want</em> salvation, not the pain of guilt. And you want your\nFather, <em>not</em> a little mound of clay, to be your home. In your holy\nrelationship is your Father’s Son. He has not lost communion with Him\nnor with himself. When you agreed to join each other, you acknowledged\nthis is so. This has no cost, but it has <em>release</em> from cost.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> You have paid very dearly for your illusions, and nothing you have\npaid for brought you peace. Are you not <em>glad</em> that Heaven cannot be\nsacrificed, and sacrifice cannot be asked of you? There <em>is</em> no obstacle\nwhich you can place before our union, for in your holy relationship, I\nam there already. We will surmount all obstacles together, for we stand\nwithin the gates and not outside. How easily the gates are opened from\nwithin to let peace through to bless the tired world! Can it be\ndifficult for us to walk past barriers together when you have joined the\nlimitless? The end of guilt is in your hands to give. Would you stop now\nto look for guilt in each other?</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> Let me be to you the symbol of the <em>end</em> of guilt, and look upon each\nother as you would look on me. Forgive me all the sins you think the Son\nof God committed. And in the light of your forgiveness, he will remember\nwho he is and forget what never was. I ask for your forgiveness, for if\nyou are guilty, so must I be. But if I surmounted guilt and overcame the\nworld, <em>you</em> were with me. Would you see in me the symbol of guilt or of\nthe <em>end</em> of guilt, remembering that what I signify to you, you see\nwithin <em>yourself</em>?</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> From your holy relationship truth proclaims the truth, and love looks\non itself. Salvation flows from deep within the home you offered to my\nFather and to me. And we are there together in the quiet communion in\nwhich the Father and the Son are joined. Oh come ye faithful to the holy\nunion of the Father and Son in you! And keep you not apart from what is\noffered you in gratitude for giving peace its home in Heaven. Send forth\nto all the world the joyous message of the end of guilt, and all the\nworld will answer. Think of your happiness as everyone offers you\nwitness of the end of sin and shows you that its power is gone forever.\nWhere can guilt be, when the belief in sin is gone? And where is death,\nwhen its great advocate is heard no more?</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> Forgive me your illusions and release me from punishment for what I\nhave not done. So will you learn the freedom that I taught by teaching\nfreedom to each other and so releasing me. I am within your holy\nrelationship, yet you would imprison me behind the obstacles you raise\nto freedom and bar my way to you. Yet it is not possible to keep away\nOne Who is there already. And in Him it <em>is</em> possible that our\ncommunion, where we are joined already, will be the focus of the new\nperception that will bring light to all the world, contained in <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"pleasure-and-pain\">Pleasure and Pain</h2>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> Your little part is but to give the Holy Spirit the whole <em>idea</em> of\nsacrifice. And to accept the peace He gave instead, without the limits\nwhich would hold its extension back and so would limit <em>your</em> awareness\nof it. For what He gives must be extended if you would have its\nlimitless power and use it for the Son of God’s release. It is not this\nyou would be rid of, and having it you <em>cannot</em> limit it. If peace is\nhomeless, so are you and so am I. And He Who is our home is homeless\n<em>with</em> us. Is this your will? Would you forever be a wanderer in search\nof peace? Would you invest your hope of peace and happiness in what\n<em>must</em> fail?</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> Faith in the eternal is always justified, for the eternal is forever\nkind, infinite in its patience, and wholly loving. It will accept you\nwholly and give you peace. Yet it can unite only with what <em>already</em> is\nat peace in you, immortal as itself. The body can bring you neither\npeace nor turmoil; neither pain nor joy. It is a means and not an end.\nIt has <em>no</em> purpose of itself, but only what is given to it. The body\nwill seem to be whatever is the means for reaching the goal that you\nassign to it. [Only the mind can set a purpose, and only mind can see\nthe means for its accomplishment and justify its use.] Peace and guilt\nare both conditions of the mind to be attained. And these conditions are\nthe home of the emotion which called them forth and therefore is\ncompatible with them. But think you which it is that is compatible with\n<em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> Here is your choice, and it <em>is</em> free. But all that lies in it <em>will</em>\ncome with it, and what you think you are can never be apart from it. The\nbody is the great seeming betrayer of faith. In it lies disillusionment\nand the seeds of faithlessness, but only if you ask of it what it cannot\ngive. Can your mistake be reasonable grounds for depression and\ndisillusionment and for retaliative attack on what you think has failed\nyou? Use not your error as the justification for your faithlessness. You\nhave not sinned, but you have been mistaken in what is faithful. And the\ncorrection of your mistake will <em>give</em> you grounds for faith.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> It is impossible to seek for pleasure through the body and <em>not</em> find\npain. It is essential that this relationship be understood, for it is\none the ego sees as <em>proof</em> of sin. It is not really punitive at all. It\nis but the inevitable result of equating yourself with the body, which\nis the <em>invitation</em> to pain. For it invites fear to enter and become\nyour purpose. The attraction of guilt <em>must</em> enter with it, and whatever\nfear directs the body to do is therefore painful. It will share the pain\nof <em>all</em> illusions, and the illusion of pleasure will be the <em>same</em> as\npain.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> Is not this inevitable? Under fear’s orders, the body will pursue\nguilt, serving its master whose attraction to guilt maintains the whole\nillusion of its existence. This, then, <em>is</em> the attraction of pain.\nRuled by this perception, the body becomes the servant of pain, seeking\nit dutifully and obeying the idea that pain is pleasure. It is this idea\nthat underlies all of the ego’s heavy investment in the body. And it is\nthis insane relationship which it keeps hidden and yet feeds upon. To\n<em>you</em> it teaches that the body’s pleasure is happiness. Yet to <em>itself</em>\nit whispers, “It is death.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> Why should the body be anything to you? Certainly what it is made of\nis not precious. And just as certainly, it has no feeling. It transmits\nto you the feelings that you <em>want</em>. Like any communication medium, the\nbody receives and sends the messages that it is given. It has no feeling\nfor them. All of the feeling with which they are invested is given by\nthe sender and the receiver. The ego and the Holy Spirit both recognize\nthis, and both also recognize that here the sender and receiver are the\n<em>same</em>. The Holy Spirit tells you this with joy. The ego hides it, for\nit would keep you unaware of it. Who would send messages of hatred and\nattack if he but understood he sends them to <em>himself</em>? Who would\naccuse, make guilty, and condemn <em>himself</em>?</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> The ego’s messages are always sent <em>away</em> from you in the belief that\nfor your message of attack and guilt will someone other than yourself\nsuffer. And even if you suffer, yet someone else will suffer more. The\ngreat deceiver recognizes that this is not so, but as the “enemy” of\npeace, it urges you to send out all your messages of hate and free\n<em>yourself</em>. And to convince you this is possible, it bids the body\nsearch for pain in attack upon another, calling it pleasure and offering\nit to you as freedom <em>from</em> attack.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> Hear not its madness, and believe not the impossible is true. Forget\nnot that the ego has dedicated the body to the goal of sin and places in\nit all its faith that this can be accomplished. Its sad disciples chant\nthe body’s praise continually, in solemn celebration of the ego’s rule.\nNot one but must believe that yielding to the attraction of guilt is the\n<em>escape</em> from pain. Not one but must regard the body as himself, without\nwhich he would die, and yet within which is his death equally\ninevitable.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> It is not given to the ego’s disciples to realize that they have\ndedicated <em>themselves</em> to death. Freedom is offered them, but they have\nnot accepted it, and what is offered must also be received to be truly\ngiven. For the Holy Spirit, too, is a communication medium, receiving\nfrom the Father and offering His messages unto the Son. Like the ego,\nthe Holy Spirit is both the sender and the receiver. For what is sent\nthrough Him <em>returns</em> to Him, seeking itself along the way and finding\nwhat it seeks. So does the ego find the death <em>it</em> seeks, returning it\nto <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"c-the-third-obstacle-the-attraction-of-death\">c. The Third Obstacle: The Attraction of Death</h2>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> To you in whose special relationship the Holy Spirit entered, it is\ngiven to release and be released from the dedication to death. For it\nwas offered you, and you <em>accepted</em>. Yet you must learn still more about\nthis strange devotion, for it contains the third of the obstacles which\npeace must flow across. No one can die unless he chooses death. What\n<em>seems</em> to be the fear of death is really its <em>attraction</em>. Guilt, too,\nis feared and fearful. Yet it could have no hold at all except on those\nwho are attracted to it and seek it out. And so it is with death. Made\nby the ego, its dark shadow falls across all living things because the\nego is the “enemy” of life.</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> And yet a shadow cannot kill. What is a shadow to the living? They\nbut walk past, and it is gone. But what of those whose dedication it is\n<em>not</em> to live—the black-draped “sinners,” the ego’s mournful chorus,\nplodding so heavily away from life, dragging their chains and marching\nin the slow procession which honors their grim master, lord of death?\nTouch any one of them with the gentle hands of forgiveness and watch the\nchains fall away along with yours. See him throw aside the black robe he\nwas wearing to his funeral and hear him laugh at death. The sentence sin\nwould lay upon him he can escape through your forgiveness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> This is not arrogance. It is the Will of God. What is impossible to\nyou who chose His Will as yours? What is death to you? <em>Your</em> dedication\nis not to death nor to its master. When you accepted the Holy Spirit’s\npurpose in place of the ego’s, you renounced death, exchanging it for\nlife. We know that an idea leaves not its source. And death is the\nresult of the thought we call the ego as surely as life is the result of\nthe Thought of God.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-incorruptible-body\">The Incorruptible Body</h2>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> From the ego came sin and guilt and death, in opposition to life and\ninnocence and to the Will of God Himself. Where can such opposition lie\nbut in the sick minds of the insane, dedicated to madness and set\nagainst the peace of Heaven? One thing is sure—God, Who created neither\nsin nor death, wills not that you be bound by them. He knows of neither\nsin nor its results. The shrouded figures in the funeral procession\nmarch not in honor of their Creator, Whose Will it is they live. They\nare not following it; they are <em>opposing</em> it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> And what is the black-draped body they would bury? A body which\n<em>they</em> dedicated to death, a symbol of corruption, a sacrifice to sin,\noffered to sin to feed upon and keep itself alive—a thing condemned,\ndamned by its maker, and lamented by every mourner who looks upon it as\nhimself. You who believe you have condemned the Son of God to this <em>are</em>\narrogant. But you who would release him are but honoring the Will of his\nCreator. The arrogance of sin, the pride of guilt, the sepulcher of\nseparation—all are part of your unrecognized dedication to death. The\nglitter of guilt you laid upon the body would kill it. For what the ego\nloves, it kills for its obedience. But what obeys it not, it <em>cannot</em>\nkill.</p>\n\n<p><sup>82</sup> You have another dedication which would keep the body incorruptible\nand perfect as long as it is useful for your holy purpose. The body no\nmore dies than it can feel. It does <em>nothing</em>. Of itself, it is neither\ncorruptible nor incorruptible. It <em>is</em> nothing. It is the result of a\ntiny mad idea of corruption which can be <em>corrected</em>. For God has\nanswered this insane idea with His own, an Answer which left Him not and\ntherefore brings the Creator to the awareness of every mind which heard\nHis Answer and <em>accepted</em> it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> You who are dedicated to the incorruptible have been given through\nyour acceptance the power to <em>release</em> from corruption. What better way\nto teach the first and fundamental principle in a course on miracles\nthan by showing you the one which seems to be the hardest can be\naccomplished first? The body can but serve your purpose. As you look\nupon it, so will it seem to be. Death, were it true, would be the final\nand complete disruption of communication which is the ego’s goal.</p>\n\n<p><sup>84</sup> Those who fear death see not how often and how loudly they call to it\nand bid it come to save them from communication. For death is seen as\nsafety, the great dark savior from the light of truth, the answer to the\nAnswer, the silencer of the Voice that speaks for God. Yet the retreat\nto death is not the end of conflict. Only <em>God’s</em> Answer is its end. The\nobstacle of your seeming love for death that peace must flow across\nseems to be very great. For in it lies hidden all the ego’s secrets, all\nits strange devices for deception, all its sick ideas and weird\nimaginings. Here is the final end of union, the triumph of the ego’s\nmaking over creation, the victory of lifelessness on Life Itself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>85</sup> Under the dusty edge of its distorted world, the ego would lay the\nSon of God, slain by its orders, proof in his decay that God Himself is\npowerless before the ego’s might, unable to protect the life that He\ncreated against the ego’s savage wish to kill. My brothers, children of\nour Father, this is a <em>dream</em> of death. There is no funeral, no dark\naltars, no grim commandments nor twisted rituals of condemnation to\nwhich the body leads you. Ask not release of <em>it</em>. But free it from the\nmerciless and unrelenting orders <em>you</em> laid upon it and forgive it what\n<em>you</em> ordered it to do. In its exaltation you commanded it to die, for\nonly death <em>could</em> conquer life. And what but insanity could look upon\nthe defeat of God and think it real?</p>\n\n<p><sup>86</sup> The fear of death will go as its appeal is yielded to love’s <em>real</em>\nattraction. The end of sin, which nestles quietly in the safety of your\nrelationship, protected by your union, ready to grow into a mighty force\nfor God, is very near. The infancy of salvation is carefully guarded by\nlove, preserved from every thought that would attack it and quietly made\nready to fulfill the mighty task for which it was given you. Your\nnewborn purpose is nursed by angels, cherished by the Holy Spirit, and\nprotected by God Himself. It needs not your protection; <em>it</em> is <em>yours</em>.\nFor it is deathless, and within it lies the end of death.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> What danger can assail the wholly innocent? What can attack the\nguiltless? What fear can enter and disturb the peace of sinlessness?\nWhat has been given you, even in its infancy, is in full communication\nwith God and you. In its tiny hands, it holds in perfect safety every\nmiracle you will perform, held out to you. The miracle of life is\nageless, born in time but nourished in eternity. Behold this infant to\nwhom you gave a resting-place by your forgiveness of each other, and see\nin it the Will of God. Here is the babe of Bethlehem reborn. And\neveryone who gives him shelter will follow him, not to the cross, but to\nthe Resurrection and the Life.</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> When anything seems to you to be a source of fear, when any situation\nstrikes you with terror and makes your body tremble and the cold sweat\nof fear comes over it, remember it is always for <em>one</em> reason—the ego\nhas perceived it as a symbol of fear, a sign of sin and death. Remember\nthen that neither sign nor symbol should be confused with source, for\nthey must stand for something <em>other</em> than themselves. Their meaning\ncannot lie in them but must be sought in what they <em>represent</em>. And they\nmay thus mean everything or nothing, according to the truth or falsity\nof the idea which they reflect. Confronted with such seeming uncertainty\nof meaning, judge it not. Remember the holy Presence of the One given to\nyou to be the Source of judgment. Give it to Him to judge for you, and\nsay:</p>\n\n<p><sup>89</sup> <em>Take this from me and look upon it, judging it for me.<br /> \nLet me not see it as a sign of sin and death nor use it for destruction.<br /> \nTeach me how <strong>not</strong> to make of it an obstacle to peace,<br /><br />\nBut let You use it <strong>for</strong> me to facilitate its coming</em>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"d-the-fourth-obstacle-the-fear-of-god\">d. The Fourth Obstacle: The Fear of God</h2>\n\n<p><sup>90</sup> What would you see without the fear of death? What would you feel and\nthink if death held no attraction for you? Very simply, you would\nremember your Father. The Creator of life, the Source of everything that\nlives, the Father of the universe and of the universe of universes and\nof everything that lies even beyond them would you remember. And as this\nmemory rises in your mind, peace must still surmount a final obstacle\nafter which is salvation completed and the Son of God entirely restored\nto sanity. For here your world <em>does</em> end.</p>\n\n<p><sup>91</sup> The fourth obstacle to be surmounted hangs like a heavy veil before\nthe face of Christ. Yet as His face rises beyond it, shining with joy\nbecause He is in His Father’s Love, peace will lightly brush the veil\naside and run to meet Him and to join with Him at last. For this dark\nveil, which seems to make the face of Christ Himself like to a leper’s\nand the bright rays of His Father’s love which light His face with glory\nappear as streams of blood, fades in the blazing light beyond it when\nthe fear of death is gone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>92</sup> This is the darkest veil, upheld by the belief in death and protected\nby its attraction. The dedication to death and to its sovereignty is but\nthe solemn vow, the promise made in secret to the ego never to lift this\nveil, not to approach it nor even to suspect that it is there. This is\nthe secret bargain made with the ego to keep what lies beyond the veil\nforever blotted out and unremembered. Here is your promise never to\nallow union to call you out of separation; the great amnesia in which\nthe memory of God seems quite forgotten; the cleavage of your Self from\nyou—<em>the fear of God</em>, the final step in your dissociation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>93</sup> See how the belief in death would seem to “save” you. For if this is\ngone, what can you fear but <em>life</em>? It is the attraction of death that\nmakes life seem to be ugly, cruel, and tyrannical. You are no more\nafraid of death than of the ego. These are your chosen <em>friends</em>. For in\nyour secret alliance with them, you have agreed never to let the fear of\nGod be lifted so you could look upon the face of Christ and join Him in\nHis Father.</p>\n\n<p><sup>94</sup> Every obstacle that peace must flow across is surmounted in just the\nsame way; the fear that raised it yields to the love beneath, and so the\nfear is gone. And so it is with this. The desire to get rid of peace and\ndrive the Holy Spirit from you fades in the presence of the quiet\nrecognition that you love Him. The exaltation of the body is given up in\nfavor of the Spirit, which you love as you could <em>never</em> love the body.\nAnd the appeal of death is lost forever as love’s attraction stirs and\ncalls to you. From beyond each of the obstacles to love, Love Itself has\ncalled, and each has been surmounted by the power of the attraction of\nwhat lies beyond. Your <em>wanting</em> fear seemed to be holding them in\nplace. Yet when you heard the voice of love beyond them, you answered\nand they disappeared.</p>\n\n<p><sup>95</sup> And now you stand in terror before what you swore never to look upon.\nYour eyes look down, remembering your promise to your “friends.” The\n“loveliness” of sin, the delicate appeal of guilt, the “holy” waxen\nimage of death, and the fear of vengeance of the ego you swore in blood\nnot to desert, all rise and bid you not to raise your eyes. For you\nrealize that if you look on this and <em>let</em> the veil be lifted, <em>they</em>\nwill be gone forever. All of your “friends,” your “protectors,” and your\n“home” will vanish. Nothing that you remember now will you remember.</p>\n\n<p><sup>96</sup> It seems to you the world will utterly abandon you if you but raise\nyour eyes. Yet all that will occur is you will leave the world forever.\nThis is the reestablishment of <em>your</em> will. Look upon it open-eyed and\nyou will nevermore believe that you are at the mercy of things beyond\nyou, forces you cannot control, and thoughts that come to you against\nyour will. It <em>is</em> your will to look on this. No mad desire, no trivial\nimpulse to forget again, no stab of fear, nor the cold sweat of seeming\ndeath can stand against your will. For what attracts you from beyond the\nveil is also deep <em>within</em> you, unseparated from it and completely one.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-lifting-of-the-veil\">The Lifting of the Veil</h2>\n\n<p><sup>97</sup> Forget not that you came this far <em>together</em>. And it was surely not\nthe ego that led you here. No obstacle to peace can be surmounted\nthrough <em>its</em> help. <em>It</em> does not open up its secrets and bid you look\non them and go beyond them. <em>It</em> would not have you see its weakness and\nlearn it has no power to keep you from the truth. The Guide Who brought\nyou here <em>remains</em> with you, and when you raise your eyes, you will be\n<em>ready</em> to look on terror with no fear at all. But first lift up your\neyes and look upon each other in innocence born of complete forgiveness\nof each other’s illusions and through the eyes of faith, which sees them\nnot.</p>\n\n<p><sup>98</sup> No one can look upon the fear of God unterrified unless he has\naccepted the Atonement and learned illusions are not real. No one can\nstand before this obstacle alone, for he could not have reached thus far\n<em>unless</em> his brother walked beside him. And no one would dare to look on\nit without complete forgiveness of his brother in his heart. Stand you\nhere a while and tremble not. You will be ready. Let us join together in\na holy instant, here in this place where the purpose <em>given</em> in a holy\ninstant has led you. And let us join in faith that He Who brought us\nhere together will offer you the innocence you need and that you will\naccept it for my love and His.</p>\n\n<p><sup>99</sup> Nor is it possible to look on this too soon. This is the place to\nwhich everyone must come when he is ready. Once he has found his\nbrother, he <em>is</em> ready. Yet merely to reach the place is not enough. A\njourney without a purpose is still meaningless, and even when it is\nover, it seems to make no sense. How can you <em>know</em> that it is over\nunless you realize its purpose <em>is</em> accomplished? Here, with the\njourney’s end before you, you <em>see</em> its purpose. And it is here you\nchoose whether to look upon it or wander on, only to return and make the\nchoice again.</p>\n\n<p><sup>100</sup> To look upon the fear of God <em>does</em> need some preparation. Only the\nsane can look on stark insanity and raving madness with pity and\ncompassion but not with fear. For only if they share in it does it seem\nfearful, and you <em>do</em> share in it until you look upon each other with\nperfect faith and love and tenderness. Before complete forgiveness, you\nstill stand unforgiving. You are afraid of God <em>because</em> you fear each\nother. Those you do not forgive <em>you fear</em>. And no one reaches love with\nfear beside him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>101</sup> This brother who stands beside you still seems to be a stranger. You\ndo not know him, and your interpretation of him is very fearful. And you\nattack him still, to keep what seems to be <em>yourself</em> unharmed. Yet in\nhis hands is your salvation. You see his madness, which you hate because\nyou <em>share</em> it. And all the pity and forgiveness that would heal it\ngives way to fear. Brothers, you <em>need</em> forgiveness of each other, for\nyou will share in madness or in Heaven together. And you will raise your\neyes in faith together or not at all.</p>\n\n<p><sup>102</sup> Beside each of you is one who offers you the chalice of Atonement,\nfor the Holy Spirit is in him. Would you hold his sins against him or\naccept his gift to you? Is this giver of salvation your friend or enemy?\nChoose which he is, remembering that you will receive of him according\nto your choice. He has in him the power to forgive your sins, as you for\nhim. Neither can give it to himself alone. And yet your savior stands\nbeside each one. Let him be what he is and seek not to make of love an\nenemy.</p>\n\n<p><sup>103</sup> Behold your Friend, the Christ Who stands beside you. How holy and\nhow beautiful He is! You thought He sinned because you cast the veil of\nsin upon Him to hide His loveliness. Yet still He holds forgiveness out\nto you to share His holiness. This “enemy,” this “stranger” still offers\nyou salvation as His Friend. The “enemies” of Christ, the worshipers of\nsin, know not Whom they attack. This is your brother, crucified by sin,\nand waiting for release from pain. Would you not offer him forgiveness,\nwhen only he can offer it to <em>you</em>? For his redemption, he will give you\nyours as surely as God created every living thing and loves it. And he\nwill give it truly, for it will be both offered and received.</p>\n\n<p><sup>104</sup> There is no grace of Heaven that you cannot offer to each other and\nreceive from your most holy Friend. Let him withhold it not, for by\nreceiving it you offer it to him. [For he <em>will</em> receive of you what\n<em>you</em> received of him.] Redemption has been given you to give each\nother, and thus receive it. Whom you forgive is free, and what you give\nyou share. Forgive the sins your brother thinks he has committed and all\nthe guilt you think you see in him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>105</sup> Here is the holy place of resurrection to which we come again; to\nwhich we will return until redemption is accomplished and <em>received</em>.\nThink who your brother is before you would condemn him. And offer thanks\nto God that he is holy and has been given the gift of holiness for\n<em>you</em>. Join him in gladness and remove all trace of guilt from his\ndisturbed and tortured mind. Help him to lift the heavy burden of sin\nyou laid upon him and he accepted as his own, and toss it lightly and\nwith happy laughter away from him. Press it not like thorns against his\nbrow, nor nail him to it unredeemed and hopeless.</p>\n\n<p><sup>106</sup> Give each other faith, for faith and hope and mercy are yours to\ngive. Into the hands that give the gift is given. Look on your brother,\nand see in him the gift of God you would receive. It is almost Easter,\nthe time of resurrection. Let us give redemption to each other and\n<em>share</em> in it that we may rise as one in resurrection and not separate\nin death. Behold the gift of freedom that I gave the Holy Spirit for\n<em>both</em> of you. And be you free together, as you offer to the Holy Spirit\nthis same gift. And giving it, receive it of Him in return for what you\ngave. He leadeth you and me together that we might meet here in this\nholy place and make the same decision.</p>\n\n<p><sup>107</sup> Free your brother here, as I freed you. Give him the self-same gift,\nnor look upon him with condemnation of any kind. See him as guiltless as\nI look on you, and overlook the sins he thinks he sees within himself.\nOffer each other freedom and complete release from sin here in the\ngarden of seeming agony and death. So will we prepare together the way\nunto the resurrection of God’s Son and let him rise again to glad\nremembrance of his Father, Who knows no sin, no death, but only life\neternal.</p>\n\n<p><sup>108</sup> Together we will disappear into the Presence beyond the veil, not to\nbe lost, but <em>found</em>; not to be seen, but <em>known</em>. And knowing, nothing\nin the plan God has established for salvation will be left undone. This\nis the journey’s purpose, without which <em>is</em> the journey meaningless.\nHere is the peace of God, given to you eternally by Him. Here is the\nrest and quiet that you seek, the reason for the journey from its\nbeginning. Heaven is the gift you owe each other, the debt of gratitude\nyou offer to the Son of God in thanks for what he is and what his Father\ncreated him to be.</p>\n\n<p><sup>109</sup> Think carefully how you would look upon the giver of this gift, for\nas you look on him, so will the gift itself appear to be. As he is seen\nas either the giver of guilt or of salvation, so will his offering be\nseen and so received. The crucified give pain because they are in pain.\nBut the redeemed give joy because they have been <em>healed</em> of pain.\nEveryone gives as he receives, but he must choose what it will <em>be</em> that\nhe receives. And he will recognize his choice by what he gives and what\nis given him. Nor is it given anything in hell or Heaven to interfere\nwith his decision.</p>\n\n<p><sup>110</sup> You came this far because the journey <em>was</em> your choice. And no one\nundertakes to do what he believes is meaningless. What you had faith in\nstill is faithful and watches over you in faith so gentle yet so strong\nthat it would lift you far <em>beyond</em> the veil and place the Son of God\nsafely within the sure protection of his Father. Here is the only\npurpose that gives this world and the long journey through this world\nwhatever meaning lies in them. Beyond this they <em>are</em> meaningless. You\nstand together, still without conviction they <em>have</em> a purpose. Yet it\nis given you to see this purpose in your holy Friend and recognize it is\nyour own.</p>\n\n",

I was a stranger and you took me in, not knowing who I\nwas. Yet for your gift of lilies you <em>will</em> know. In your forgiveness of\nthis stranger, alien to you and yet your ancient Friend, lie his release\nand your redemption with him. The time of Easter is a time of joy and\nnot of mourning.

Would you employ this hated\nthing to draw your brother to you and to attract his body’s eyes? Learn\nyou but offer him a crown of thorns, not recognizing it for what it is\nand trying to justify your own interpretation of its value by his\nacceptance. Yet still the gift proclaims his worthlessness to you, as\nhis acceptance and delight acknowledges the lack of value he places on\nhimself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> Gifts are not made through bodies if they be truly given and received.\nFor bodies can neither offer nor accept; hold out nor take. Only the\nmind can value, and only the mind decides on what it would receive and\ngive. And every gift it offers depends on what it <em>wants</em>. It will adorn\nits chosen home most carefully, making it ready to receive the gifts it\nwants by offering them to those who come unto its chosen home or those\nit would attract to it. And there they will exchange their gifts,\noffering and receiving what their minds judge to be worthy of them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> Each gift is an evaluation of the receiver and the <em>giver</em>. No one but\nsees in his chosen home an altar to himself. No one but seeks to draw to\nit the worshipers of what he placed upon it, making it worthy of their\ndevotion. And each has set a light upon his altar, that they may see\nwhat he has placed upon it and take it for their own. Here is the value\nthat you lay upon your brother and on yourself.

Offer him lilies and it is <em>yourself</em> you free.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> I have great need for lilies, for the Son of God has not forgiven me.\nAnd can I offer him forgiveness when he offers thorns to me?

But look you first upon the altar in your\nchosen home and see what you have laid upon it to offer me. If it be\nthorns whose points gleam sharply in a blood-red light, the body is your\nchosen home, and it is separation that you offer me. And yet the thorns\nare gone.

It has been\ngiven you to see no thorns, no strangers, and no obstacles to peace. The\nfear of God is nothing to you now. Who is afraid to look upon illusions,\nknowing his savior stands beside him? With him, your vision has become\nthe greatest power for the undoing of illusion that God Himself could\ngive. For what God gave the Holy Spirit, you have received. The Son of\nGod looks unto you for his release. For you have asked for and been\ngiven the strength to look upon this final obstacle and see no thorns\nnor nails to crucify the Son of God and crown him king of death. Your\nchosen home is on the other side, beyond the veil. It has been carefully\nprepared for you, and it is ready to receive you now. You will not see\nit with the body’s eyes. Yet all you need you have.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> Your home has called to you since time began, nor have you ever\nfailed entirely to hear. You heard but knew not <em>how</em> to look nor\n<em>where</em>. And now you know. In you the knowledge lies, ready to be\nunveiled and freed from all the terror that kept it hidden. There <em>is</em>\nno fear in love. The song of Easter is the glad refrain the Son of God\nwas <em>never</em> crucified. Let us lift up our eyes together, not in fear,\nbut faith. And there <em>will</em> be no fear in us, for in our vision will be\nno illusions—only a pathway to the open door of Heaven, the home we\nshare in quietness, and where we live in gentleness and peace as one\ntogether.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> Would you not have your holy brother lead you there? His innocence\nwill light your way, offering you its guiding light and sure protection,\nand shining from the holy altar within him where you laid the lilies of\nforgiveness.

The holiness\nthat leads us is <em>within</em> us, as is our home. So will we find what we\nwere meant to find by Him Who leads us.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> This is the way to Heaven and to the peace of Easter, in which we\njoin in glad awareness that the Son of God is risen from the past and\nhas awakened to the present. Now is he free, unlimited in his communion\nwith all that is within him. Now are the lilies of his innocence\nuntouched by guilt and perfectly protected from the cold chill of fear\nand withering blight of sin alike. Your gift has saved him from the\nthorns and nails, and his strong arm is free to guide you safely through\nthem and beyond. Walk with him now rejoicing, for the savior from\nillusions has come to greet you and lead you home with him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> Here is your savior and your friend, released from crucifixion\nthrough your vision and free to lead you now where <em>he</em> would be. He\nwill not leave you nor forsake the savior from his pain. And gladly will\nyou walk the way of innocence together, singing as you behold the open\ndoor of Heaven, and recognize the home that called to you. Give joyously\nto one another the freedom and the strength to lead you there. And come\nbefore each other’s holy altar where the strength and freedom wait, to\noffer and receive the bright awareness that leads you home. The lamp is\nlit in both of you for one another. And by the hands that gave it to\neach other shall both of you be led past fear to love.</p>\n\n",

And an adjustment is a\n<em>change;</em> a shift in perception or a belief that what was so before has\nbeen made different. Every adjustment is therefore a distortion and\ncalls upon defenses to uphold it against reality. Knowledge requires\n<em>no</em> adjustment and in fact is lost if any shift or change is\nundertaken. For this reduces it at once to mere perception—a way of\n<em>looking</em> in which certainty is lost and doubt has entered. To this\nimpaired condition <em>are</em> adjustments necessary because they are not\ntrue. Who need adjust to truth, which calls on only what he is, to\nunderstand?</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> Adjustments of any kind are of the ego. For it is the ego’s fixed\nbelief that all relationships <em>depend</em> upon adjustments to make of them\nwhat it would have them be. Direct relationships, in which there are no\ninterferences, are <em>always</em> seen as dangerous. The ego is the\nself-appointed mediator of all relationships, making whatever\nadjustments it deems necessary and interposing them between those who\nwould meet to keep them separate and prevent their union. It is this\nstudied interference which makes it difficult for you to recognize your\nholy relationship for what it is.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> The holy do not interfere with truth. They are not afraid of it, for\nit is within the truth they recognized their holiness and rejoiced at\nwhat they saw. They looked on it directly, without attempting to adjust\nthemselves to it or it to them. And so they saw that it was <em>in</em> them,\nnot deciding first where they would <em>have</em> it be. Their looking merely\nasked a question, and it was what they <em>saw</em> that answered them. <em>You</em>\nmake the world and <em>then</em> adjust to it, and it to you. Nor is there any\ndifference between yourself and it in your perception, which made them\n<em>both</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> A simple question yet remains and needs an answer. Do you <em>like</em> what\nyou have made—a world of murder and attack through which you thread your\ntimid way through constant dangers, alone and frightened, hoping at most\nthat death will wait a little longer before it overtakes you and you\ndisappear? <em>You made this up</em>. It is a picture of what you think <em>you</em>\nare, of how you see <em>yourself</em>. A murderer <em>is</em> frightened, and those\nwho kill <em>fear</em> death. All these are but the fearful thoughts of those\nwho would adjust themselves to a world made fearful by their\nadjustments. And they look out in sorrow from what is sad within and see\nthe sadness <em>there.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> Have you not wondered what the world is <em>really</em> like; how it would\nlook through <em>happy</em> eyes? The world you see is but a judgment on\nyourself. It is not there at all. Yet judgment lays a sentence on it,\njustifies it, and makes it <em>real</em>. Such is the world you see—a judgment\non yourself and made by <em>you</em>. This sickly picture of yourself is\ncarefully preserved by the ego, whose image it is and which it loves,\nand placed outside you in the world. And to this world must you adjust,\nas long as you believe this picture is outside and has you at its mercy.\nThis world <em>is</em> merciless, and were it outside you, you should indeed be\nfearful. Yet it was you who <em>made</em> it merciless, and now if\nmercilessness seems to look back at you, it can be <em>corrected</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> Who in a holy relationship can long remain unholy? The world the holy\nsee is one with them, just as the world the ego looks upon is like\nitself. The world the holy see is beautiful because they see their\ninnocence in it. They did not tell it what it was; they did not make\nadjustments to fit their orders. They gently questioned it and\nwhispered, “What are you?” And He Who watches over all perception\nanswered. Take not the judgment of the world as answer to the question,\n“What am I?”</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> The world <em>believes</em> in sin, but the belief that made it as you see\nit is not outside you. Seek not to make the Son of God <em>adjust</em> to his\ninsanity. There <em>is</em> a stranger in him who wandered carelessly into the\nhome of truth, and who will wander off. He came without a purpose, but\nhe will not remain before the shining light the Holy Spirit offered and\nyou accepted. For there the stranger is made homeless and <em>you</em> are\nwelcome.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> Ask not this transient stranger, “What am I?” He is the only thing in\nall the universe that does not know. Yet it is he you asked, and it is\nto his answer that you would adjust. This one wild thought, fierce in\nits arrogance and yet so tiny and so meaningless it slips unnoticed\nthrough the universe of truth, becomes your guide. To it you turn to ask\nthe meaning of the universe. And of the one blind thing in all the\nseeing universe of truth you ask, “How shall I look upon the Son of\nGod?”</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> Does one ask judgment of what is totally <em>bereft</em> of judgment? And if\nyou have, would you <em>believe</em> the answer and adjust to it as if it were\nthe truth? The world you look on is the answer that it gave you, and\n<em>you</em> have given it power to adjust the world to <em>make</em> its answer true.\nYou asked this puff of madness for the meaning of your unholy\nrelationship and adjusted it according to its insane answer. How happy\ndid it make you? Did you meet with joy to bless the Son of God and give\nhim thanks for all the happiness which he held out to you? Did you\nrecognize each other as the eternal gift of God to you? Did you see the\nholiness that shone in both of you to bless the other? That is the\npurpose of your <em>holy</em> relationship. Ask not the means of its attainment\nof the one thing that still would have it be unholy. Give it <em>no</em> power\nto adjust the means and end.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> Prisoners bound with heavy chains for years, starved and emaciated,\nweak and exhausted and with eyes so long cast down in darkness they\nremember not the light, do not leap up in joy the instant they are made\nfree. It takes a while for them to understand what freedom <em>is</em>. You\ngroped but feebly in the dust and found each other’s hand, uncertain\nwhether to let it go or to take hold on life so long forgotten.\nStrengthen your hold and raise your eyes unto your strong companion, in\nwhom the meaning of your freedom lies. He seemed to be crucified beside\nyou. And yet his holiness remained untouched and perfect, and with him\nbeside you, you shall this day enter with him to Paradise and know the\npeace of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> Such is my will for both of you and for each of you for one another\nand for himself. Here there is only holiness and joining without limit.\nFor what is Heaven but union, direct and perfect, and without the veil\nof fear upon it? Here are we one, looking with perfect gentleness upon\neach other and on ourselves. Here all thoughts of any separation between\nus become impossible. You who were prisoners in separation are now made\nfree in Paradise. And here would I unite with you, my friends, my\nbrothers, and my Self. Your gift unto each other has given me the\ncertainty our union will be soon.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> Share, then, this faith with me and know that it is justified. There\nis no fear in perfect love <em>because</em> it knows no sin and it must look on\nothers as on itself. Looking with charity within, what can it fear\n<em>without</em>? The innocent see safety, and the pure in heart see God within\nHis Son and look unto the Son to lead them to the Father. And where else\nwould they go but where they will to be? Each of you now will lead the\nother to the Father as surely as God created His Son holy and kept him\nso. In your brother is the light of God’s eternal promise of your\nimmortality. See <em>him</em> as sinless, and there can <em>be</em> no fear in you.</p>\n\n",

It is not up to you to give power at all. Power is of God, given\nby Him and reawakened by the Holy Spirit, Who knows that as you give,\nyou <em>gain</em>. He gives no power to sin, and therefore it <em>has</em> none; nor\nto its results as this world sees them—sickness and death and misery and\npain. These things have not occurred because the Holy Spirit sees them\nnot and gives no power to their seeming source. Thus would He keep you\nfree of them. Being without illusion of what you are, the Holy Spirit\nmerely gives everything to God, Who has already given and received all\nthat is true. The untrue He has neither received <em>nor</em> given.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> Sin has no place in Heaven, where its results are alien and can no\nmore enter than can their source. And therein lies your need to see your\nbrother sinless. In him is Heaven. See sin in him instead, and Heaven is\nlost to you. But see him as he is, and what is yours shines from him to\nyou. Your savior gives you only love, but what you would <em>receive</em> of\nhim is up to you. It lies in him to overlook all your mistakes, and\ntherein lies his <em>own</em> salvation. And so it is with yours. [Salvation\nis a lesson in giving, as the Holy Spirit interprets it.] It is the\nreawakening of the laws of God in minds that have established other laws\nand given them power to enforce what God created not.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> <em>Your</em> insane laws were made to guarantee that you would make\nmistakes and give them power over you by accepting their results as your\njust due. What could this be but madness? And is it this that you would\nsee within your savior from insanity? He is as free from this as you\nare, and in the freedom that you see in him, you see your own. For this\nyou <em>share.</em> What God has given follows His laws and His alone. Nor is\nit possible for those who follow them to suffer the results of any other\nsource.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> Those who choose freedom will experience only its results. Their\npower is of God, and they will give it only to what God has given to\nshare with them. Nothing but this can touch them, for they see only\nthis, sharing their power according to the Will of God. And thus their\nfreedom is established and maintained. It is upheld through all\ntemptation to imprison and to be imprisoned. It is of them who learned\nof freedom that you should ask what freedom is. Ask not the sparrow how\nthe eagle soars, for those with little wings have not accepted for\nthemselves the power to share with you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> The sinless give as they received. See, then, the power of\nsinlessness within your brother and share with him the power of the\nrelease from sin you offered him. To each who walks this earth in\nseeming solitude is a savior given, whose special function here is to\nrelease him and so to free himself. In the world of separation, each is\nappointed separately, though they are all the same. Yet those who <em>know</em>\nthat they are all the same need not salvation. And each one finds his\nsavior when he is ready to look upon the face of Christ and see Him\nsinless.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> The plan is not of you, nor need you be concerned with anything\nexcept the part that has been given you to learn. For He Who knows the\nrest will see to it without your help. But think not that He does not\nneed your part to help Him with the rest. For in your part lies <em>all</em> of\nit, without which is no part complete, nor is the whole completed\nwithout your part. The ark of peace is entered two by two, yet the\nbeginning of another world goes with them. Each holy relationship must\nenter here to learn its special function in the Holy Spirit’s plan, now\nthat it shares His purpose. And as this purpose is fulfilled, a new\nworld rises in which sin can enter not, and where the Son of God can\nenter without fear, and where he rests a while to forget imprisonment\nand to remember freedom. How can he enter, to rest and to remember,\nwithout <em>you</em>? Except you be there, he is not complete. And it is his\ncompletion that he remembers there.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> This is the purpose given you. Think not that your forgiveness of\neach other serves but you two alone. For the whole new world rests in\nthe hands of every two who enter here to rest. And as they rest, the\nface of Christ shines on them, and they remember the laws of God,\nforgetting all the rest and yearning only to have His laws perfectly\nfulfilled in them and all their brothers. Think you when this has been\nachieved that you will rest <em>without</em> them? You could no more leave one\nof them outside than I could leave you and forget part of myself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> You may wonder how you can be at peace when, while you are in time,\nthere is so much that must be done before the way to peace is open.\nPerhaps this seems impossible to you. But ask yourself if it is possible\nthat God would have a plan for your salvation that does <em>not</em> work. Once\nyou accept His plan as the one function that you would fulfill, there\nwill be nothing else the Holy Spirit will not arrange for you <em>without</em>\nyour effort.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> He will go before you making straight your path and leaving in your\nway no stones to trip on and no obstacles to bar your way. Nothing you\nneed will be denied you. Not one seeming difficulty but will melt away\nbefore you reach it. You need take thought for nothing, careless of\neverything except the only purpose that you would fulfill. As that was\ngiven you, so will its fulfillment be. God’s guarantee will hold against\nall obstacles, for it rests on certainty and not contingency. It rests\non <em>you</em>. And what can be more certain than a Son of God?</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>37</sup> In this world, God’s Son comes closest to himself in a holy\nrelationship. There he begins to find the certainty his Father has in\nhim. And there he finds his function of restoring his Father’s laws to\nwhat was held outside them and finding what was lost. Only in time can\n<em>anything</em> be lost, and <em>never</em> lost forever. So do the parts of God’s\nSon gradually join in time, and with each joining is the end of time\nbrought nearer. Each miracle of joining is a mighty herald of eternity.\nNo one who has a single purpose, unified and sure, can be afraid. No one\nwho shares his purpose with him can <em>not</em> be one with him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> Each herald of eternity sings of the end of sin and fear. Each speaks\nin time of what is far beyond it. Two voices raised together call to the\nhearts of everyone and let them beat as one. And in that single heart\nbeat is the unity of love proclaimed and given welcome. Peace to your\nholy relationship, which has the power to hold the unity of the Son of\nGod together. You give to one another for everyone, and in your gift is\neveryone made glad. Forget not Who has given you the gifts you give, and\nthrough your not forgetting this will you remember Who gave the gifts to\nHim to give to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> It is impossible to overestimate your brother’s value. Only the ego\ndoes this, but all <em>it</em> means is that it wants the other for itself and\ntherefore values him too <em>little</em>. What is inestimable clearly cannot\n<em>be</em> evaluated. Do you recognize the fear that rises from the\nmeaningless attempt to judge what lies so far beyond your judgment you\ncannot even see it? Judge not what is invisible to you or you will\n<em>never</em> see it, but wait in patience for its coming. It will be given\nyou to see your brother’s worth when all you want for him is peace. And\nwhat you want for him, you will receive.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> How can you estimate the worth of him who offers peace to you? What\nwould you <em>want</em> except his offering? His worth has been established by\nhis Father, and you will recognize it as you receive his Father’s gift\nthrough him. What is in him will shine so brightly in your grateful\nvision that you will merely love him and be glad. You will not think to\njudge him, for who would see the face of Christ and yet insist that\njudgment still has meaning? For this insistence is of those who do <em>not</em>\nsee. Vision or judgment is your choice, but never both of these.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> Your brother’s body is as little use to you as it is to him. When it\nis used only as the Holy Spirit teaches, it <em>has</em> no function, for minds\nneed not the body to communicate. The sight that sees the body has no\nuse which serves the purpose of a holy relationship. And while you look\nupon each other thus, the means and end have not been brought in line.\nWhy should it take so many holy instants to let this be accomplished,\nwhen one would do? There <em>is</em> but one. The little breath of eternity\nthat runs through time like golden light is all the same—nothing before\nit, nothing afterwards.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> <em>You</em> look upon each holy instant as a different point in time. <em>It</em>\nnever changes. All that it ever held or will ever hold is here right\n<em>now</em>. The past takes nothing from it, and the future will add no more.\nHere, then, is everything. Here is the loveliness of your relationship,\nwith means and end in perfect harmony <em>already</em>. Here is the perfect\nfaith that you will one day offer to each other <em>already</em> offered you.\nAnd here the limitless forgiveness you will give each other <em>already</em>\ngiven; the face of Christ you yet will look upon <em>already</em> seen.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> Can you evaluate the giver of a gift like this? Would you exchange\nthis gift for any other? This gift returns the laws of God to your\nremembrance. And merely by remembering them, the laws that held you\nprisoner to pain and death <em>must</em> be forgotten. This is no gift your\nbrother’s body offers you. The veil that hides the gift hides him as\nwell. He <em>is</em> the gift, and yet he knows it not. No more do you. And\nyet, have faith that He Who sees the gift in both of you will offer and\nreceive it for you both. And through His vision will you see it, and\nthrough His understanding recognize it and love it as your own.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> Be comforted and feel the Holy Spirit watching over you in love and\nperfect confidence in what He sees. He <em>knows</em> the Son of God and shares\nhis Father’s certainty the universe rests in his gentle hands in safety\nand in peace. Let us consider now what he must learn, to share his\nFather’s confidence in him. What is he, that the Creator of the universe\nshould offer it to him and know it rests in safety? He looks upon\nhimself not as his Father knows him. And yet it is impossible the\nconfidence of God should be misplaced.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>45</sup> The meaning of the Son of God lies solely in his relationship with\nhis Creator. If it were elsewhere, it would rest upon contingency, but\nthere <em>is</em> nothing else. And this is wholly loving and forever. Yet has\nthe Son of God invented an unholy relationship between him and his\nFather. His real relationship is one of perfect union and unbroken\ncontinuity. The one he made is partial, self-centered, broken into\nfragments, and full of fear. The one created by his Father is wholly\nself-encompassing and self-extending. The one he made is wholly\nself-destructive and self-limiting.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> Nothing can show the contrast better than the experience of both a\nholy and an unholy relationship. The first is based on love and rests on\nit, serene and undisturbed. The body does not intrude upon it. Any\nrelationship in which the body enters is based not on love, but on\nidolatry. Love wishes to be known, completely understood, and shared. It\nhas no secrets; nothing that it would keep apart and hide. It walks in\nsunlight, open-eyed and calm, in smiling welcome and in sincerity so\nsimple and so obvious it cannot <em>be</em> misunderstood. But idols do not\nshare.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> Idols accept, but never make return. They can be loved, but cannot\nlove. They do not understand what they are offered, and any relationship\nin which they enter has lost its meaning. They live in secrecy, hating\nthe sunlight and happy in the body’s darkness where they can hide and\nkeep their secrets hidden along with them. And they have <em>no</em>\nrelationships, for no one else is welcome there. They smile on no one,\nand those who smile on them they do not see.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> Love has no darkened temples where mysteries are kept obscure and\nhidden from the sun. It does not seek for power, but for relationships.\nThe body is the ego’s chosen weapon for seeking power <em>through</em>\nrelationships. And its relationships <em>must</em> be unholy, for what they\nare, it does not even see. It wants them solely for the offerings on\nwhich its idols thrive. The rest it merely throws away, for all that it\ncould offer is seen as valueless. Homeless, the ego seeks as many bodies\nas it can collect to place its idols in and so establish them as temples\nto itself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> The Holy Spirit’s temple is not a body, but a relationship. The body\nis an isolated speck of darkness; a hidden secret room, a tiny spot of\nsenseless mystery, a meaningless enclosure carefully protected, yet\nhiding nothing. Here the unholy relationship escapes reality and seeks\nfor crumbs to keep itself alive. Here it would drag its brothers,\nholding them here in its idolatry. Here it is “safe,” for here love\ncannot enter. The Holy Spirit does not build His temples where love can\nnever be. Would He Who sees the face of Christ choose as His home the\nonly place in all the universe where it can <em>not</em> be seen?</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> You <em>cannot</em> make the body the Holy Spirit’s temple, and it will\n<em>never</em> be the seat of love. It is the home of the idolater and of\nlove’s condemnation. For here is love made fearful and hope abandoned.\nEven the idols that are worshiped here are shrouded in mystery and kept\napart from those who worship them. This is the temple dedicated to no\nrelationships and no return. Here is the “mystery” of separation\nperceived in awe and held in reverence. What God would have <em>not</em> be is\nhere kept “safe” from Him. But what you do not realize is what you fear\nwithin your brother and would not see in him is what makes God seem\nfearful to you and kept unknown.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> Idolaters will always be afraid of love, for nothing so severely\nthreatens them as love’s approach. Let love draw near them and overlook\nthe body, as it will surely do, and they retreat in fear, feeling the\nseeming firm foundation of their temple begin to shake and loosen.\nBrothers, you tremble with them. Yet what you fear is but the herald of\nescape. This place of darkness is not your home. Your temple is not\nthreatened. You are idolaters no longer. The Holy Spirit’s purpose lies\nsafe in your relationship and not your bodies. You have <em>escaped</em> the\nbody. Where you are the body cannot enter, for the Holy Spirit has set\n<em>His</em> temple there.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> There is no order in relationships. They either <em>are</em> or not. An\nunholy relationship is <em>no</em> relationship. It is a state of isolation\nwhich seems to be what it is not. No more than that. The instant that\nthe mad idea of making your relationship with God unholy seemed to be\npossible, all your relationships were made meaningless. In that unholy\ninstant, time was born and bodies made to house the mad idea and give it\nthe illusion of reality. And so it seemed to have a home that held\ntogether for a little while in time and vanished. For what could house\nthis mad idea against reality <em>but</em> for an instant?</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> Idols <em>must</em> disappear and leave no trace behind their going. The\nunholy instant of their seeming power is frail as is a snowflake, but\nwithout its loveliness. Is this the substitute you <em>want</em> for the\neternal blessing of the holy instant and its unlimited beneficence? Is\nthe malevolence of the unholy relationship, so seeming powerful and so\nbitterly misunderstood and so invested in a false attraction, your\npreference to the holy instant which offers you peace and understanding?\nThen lay aside the body and quietly transcend it, rising to welcome what\nyou <em>really</em> want. And from His holy temple, look you not back on what\nyou have awakened from. For no illusions <em>can</em> attract the minds that\nhave transcended them and left them far behind.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> The holy relationship reflects the true relationship the Son of God\nhas with his Father in reality. The Holy Spirit rests within it in the\ncertainty it will endure forever. Its firm foundation is eternally\nupheld by truth, and love shines on it with the gentle smile and tender\nblessing it offers to its own. Here the unholy instant is exchanged in\ngladness for the holy one of safe return. Here is the way to true\nrelationships held gently open, through which you walk together, leaving\nthe body thankfully behind and resting in the Everlasting Arms. Love’s\narms are open to receive you and give you peace forever.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> The body is the ego’s idol; the belief in sin made flesh and then\nprojected outward. This produces what seems to be a wall of flesh around\nthe mind, keeping it prisoner in a tiny spot of space and time, beholden\nunto death and given but an instant in which to sigh and grieve and die\nin honor of its master. And this unholy instant seems to be life; an\ninstant of despair, a tiny island of dry sand, bereft of water and set\nuncertainly upon oblivion. Here does the Son of God stop briefly by to\noffer his devotion to death’s idols, and then pass on. And here he is\nmore dead than living. Yet it is also here he makes his choice again\nbetween idolatry and love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Here it is given him to choose to spend this instant paying tribute\nto the body or let himself be given freedom from it. Here he can accept\nthe holy instant, offered him to replace the unholy one he chose before.\nAnd here can he learn relationships are his <em>salvation</em> and not his\ndoom. You who are learning this may still be fearful, but you are not\nimmobilized. The holy instant is of greater value now to you than its\nunholy seeming counterpart, and you have learned you really <em>want</em> but\none. This is no time for sadness. Perhaps confusion, but hardly\ndiscouragement.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> You have a <em>real</em> relationship, and it <em>has</em> meaning. It is as like\nyour real relationship with God as equal things are like unto each\nother. Idolatry is past and meaningless. Perhaps you fear each other a\nlittle yet; perhaps a shadow of the fear of God remains with you. Yet\nwhat is that to those who have been given one true relationship <em>beyond</em>\nthe body? Can they be long held back from looking on the face of Christ?\nAnd can they long withhold the memory of their relationship with their\nFather from themselves and keep remembrance of His love apart from their\nawareness?</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>58</sup> We have said much about discrepancies of means and end and how these\nmust be brought in line before your holy relationship can bring you only\njoy. But we have also said the means to meet the Holy Spirit’s goal will\ncome from the same Source as does His purpose. Being so simple and\ndirect, this course has nothing in it that is not consistent. The\nseeming inconsistencies or parts you find more difficult than others are\nmerely indications of areas where means and end are still discrepant.\nAnd this produces great discomfort. This need not be. This course\nrequires almost nothing of you. It is impossible to imagine one that\nasks so little or could offer more.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> The period of discomfort that follows the sudden change in a\nrelationship from sin to holiness should now be almost over. To the\nextent you still experience it, you are refusing to leave the means to\nHim Who changed the purpose. You recognize you want the goal. Are you\nnot also willing to accept the means? If you are not, let us admit that\n<em>you</em> are inconsistent. A purpose is <em>attained</em> by means, and if you\nwant a purpose, you <em>must</em> be willing to want the means as well. How can\none be sincere and say, “I want this above all else, and yet I do not\nwant to learn the means to get it”?</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> To obtain the goal, the Holy Spirit indeed asked little. He asks no\nmore to give the means as well. The means are second to the goal. And\nwhen you hesitate, it is because the <em>purpose</em> frightens you, and <em>not</em>\nthe means. Remember this, for otherwise you will make the error of\nbelieving the means are difficult. Yet how can they be difficult if they\nare merely <em>given</em> you? They guarantee the goal, and they are perfectly\nin line with it. Before we look at them a little closer, remember that\nif you think they are impossible, your wanting of the <em>purpose</em> has been\nshaken. For if a goal is possible to reach, the means to do so must be\npossible as well.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> It <em>is</em> impossible to see your brother as sinless and yet to look\nupon him as a body. Is this not perfectly consistent with the goal of\nholiness? For holiness is merely the result of letting the effects of\nsin be lifted so what was always true is recognized. To see a sinless\n<em>body</em> is impossible, for holiness is positive, and the body is merely\nneutral. It is not sinful, but neither is it sinless. As nothing, which\nit is, the body cannot meaningfully be invested with attributes of\nChrist <em>or</em> of the ego. Either must be an error, for both would place\nthe attributes where they cannot be. And both must be undone for\npurposes of truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> The body <em>is</em> the means by which the ego tries to make the unholy\nrelationship seem real. The unholy instant <em>is</em> the time of bodies. But\nthe <em>purpose</em> here is sin. It cannot be attained <em>but</em> in illusion, and\nso the illusion of a brother as a body is quite in keeping with the\npurpose of unholiness. Because of this consistency, the means remain\nunquestioned while the end is cherished. Vision adapts to wish, for\nsight is always secondary to desire. And if you see the body, you have\nchosen judgment and not vision. For vision, like relationships, has no\norder. You either <em>see</em> or not.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> Who sees a brother’s body has laid a judgment on him and sees him\nnot. He does not really see him as sinful; he does not see him at all.\nIn the darkness of sin, he is invisible. He can but be imagined in the\ndarkness, and it is here that the illusions you hold about him are not\nheld up to his reality. Here are illusions and reality kept separated.\nHere are illusions never brought to truth and always hidden from it. And\nhere in darkness is your brother’s reality imagined as a body, in unholy\nrelationships with other bodies, serving the cause of sin an instant\nbefore he dies.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> There is indeed a difference between this vain imagining and vision.\nThe difference lies not in them, but in their purpose. Both are but\nmeans, each one appropriate to the end for which it is employed. Neither\ncan serve the purpose of the other, for each one is a choice of purpose,\nemployed on its behalf. Either is meaningless without the end for which\nit was intended, nor is it valued as a separate thing apart from the\nintention. The means seem real because the <em>goal</em> is valued. And\njudgment has no value <em>unless</em> the goal is sin.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> The body cannot be looked upon except through judgment. To see the\nbody is the sign that you lack vision and have denied the means the Holy\nSpirit offers you to serve <em>His</em> purpose. How can a holy relationship\nachieve its purpose through the means of sin? Judgment you taught\nyourself; vision is learned from Him Who would <em>undo</em> your teaching. His\nvision cannot see the body because it cannot look on sin. And thus it\nleads you to reality. Your holy brother, sight of whom is your release,\nis no illusion. Attempt to see him not in darkness, for your imaginings\nabout him <em>will</em> seem real there. You closed your eyes to shut him out.\nSuch was your purpose, and while this purpose seems to have any meaning,\nthe means for its attainment will be evaluated as worth the seeing, and\nso you will not see.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> Your question should not be, “How can I see my brother without the\nbody?” Ask only, “Do I <em>really</em> wish to see him sinless?” And as you\nask, forget not that his sinlessness is <em>your</em> escape from fear.\nSalvation is the Holy Spirit’s goal. The means is vision. For what the\nseeing look upon <em>is</em> sinless. No one who loves can judge, and what he\nsees <em>is</em> free of condemnation. And what he sees he did not make, for it\nwas given him to see, as was the vision which made his seeing possible.</p>\n\n",

Truth is\nrestored to you through your desire, as it was lost to you through your\ndesire for something else. Open the holy place which you closed off by\nvaluing the “something else,” and what was never lost will quietly\nreturn. It has been saved for you. Vision would not be necessary had\njudgment not been made. Desire now its whole undoing, and it is done for\nyou.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> Do you not <em>want</em> to know your own Identity? Would you not happily\nexchange your doubts for certainty? Would you not willingly be free of\nmisery and learn again of joy? Your holy relationship offers all this to\nyou. As it was given you, so will be its effects. And as its holy\npurpose was not made by you, the means by which its happy end is yours\nis also not of you. Rejoice in what is yours but for the asking and\nthink not that you need make either means or end. All this is given you\nwho would but see your brother sinless. All this is given, waiting on\nyour desire but to receive it. Vision is freely given to those who ask\nto see.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> Your brother’s sinlessness is given you in shining light, to look on\nwith the Holy Spirit’s vision and to rejoice in along with Him. For\npeace will come to all who ask for it with real desire and sincerity of\npurpose, shared with the Holy Spirit and at one with Him on what\nsalvation <em>is</em>. Be willing, then, to see your brother sinless that\nChrist may rise before your vision and give you joy. And place no value\non your brother’s body, which holds him to illusions of what he is. It\nis <em>his</em> desire to see his sinlessness, as it is <em>yours</em>. And bless the\nSon of God in your relationship, nor see in him what you have made of\nhim.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> The Holy Spirit guarantees that what God willed and gave you shall be\nyours. This is your purpose now, and the vision that makes it yours is\nready to be given. You have the vision which enables each one to see the\nbody not. And as you look upon each other, you will see an altar to your\nFather, holy as Heaven, glowing with radiant purity and sparkling with\nthe shining lilies you laid upon it. What can you value more than this?\nWhy do you think the body is a better home, a safer shelter for God’s\nSon? Why would you rather look on it than on the truth? How can the\nengine of destruction be <em>preferred</em> and chosen to replace the holy home\nthe Holy Spirit offers, where He will dwell with you?</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> The body is the sign of weakness, vulnerability, and loss of power.\nCan such a savior <em>help</em> you? Would you turn in your distress and need\nfor help unto the helpless? Is the pitifully little the perfect choice\nto call upon for strength? Judgment <em>will</em> seem to make your savior\nweak. Yet it is <em>you</em> who need his strength. There is no problem, no\nevent or situation, no perplexity that vision will not solve. All is\nredeemed when looked upon with vision. For this is not <em>your</em> sight, and\nbrings with it the laws beloved of Him Whose sight it <em>is.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> Everything looked upon with vision falls gently into place according\nto the laws brought to it by His calm and certain sight. The end for\neverything He looks upon is always sure. For it will meet His purpose,\nseen in unadjusted form and suited perfectly to meet it. Destructiveness\nbecomes benign, and sin is turned to blessing under His gentle gaze.\nWhat can the body’s eyes perceive, with power to <em>correct</em>? Its eyes\n<em>adjust</em> to sin, unable to overlook it in any form and seeing it\neverywhere, in everything. Look through its eyes, and everything will\nstand condemned before you. All that could save you, you will never see.\nYour holy relationship, the source of your salvation, will be deprived\nof meaning, and its most holy purpose bereft of means for its\naccomplishment.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> Judgment is but a toy, a whim, the senseless means to play the idle\ngame of death in your imagination. But vision sets all things right,\nbringing them gently within the kindly sway of Heaven’s laws. What if\nyou recognized this world is an hallucination? What if you really\nunderstood you made it up? What if you realized that those who seem to\nwalk about in it, to sin and die, attack and murder and destroy\nthemselves, are wholly unreal? Could you have faith in what you see if\nyou <em>accepted</em> this? And would you <em>see</em> it?</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> Hallucinations disappear when they are recognized for what they\n<em>are</em>. This is the healing and the remedy. Believe them not, and they\nare gone. And all you need to do is recognize <em>you</em> did this. Once you\naccept this simple fact and take unto yourself the power you gave them,\n<em>you</em> are released from them. One thing is sure—hallucinations serve a\npurpose, and when that purpose is no longer held, they disappear.\nTherefore, the question never is whether you want <em>them</em>, but always, do\nyou want the purpose which they serve? This world seems to hold out many\npurposes, each different and with different values. Yet they are all the\nsame. Again there is no order but a seeming hierarchy of values.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> Only two purposes are possible. And one is sin, the other holiness.\nNothing is in between, and which you choose determines what you see. For\nwhat you see is merely how you elect to meet your goal. Hallucinations\nserve to meet the goal of madness. They are the means by which the\noutside world, projected from within, adjusts to sin and seems to\nwitness to its reality. It still is true that nothing is without. Yet\nupon nothing are <em>all</em> projections made. For it is the projection which\ngives the “nothing” all the meaning that it holds.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> What has no meaning cannot <em>be</em> perceived. And meaning always looks\nwithin to find itself and <em>then</em> looks out. All meaning that you give\nthe world outside must thus reflect the sight you saw within; or better,\nif you saw at all or merely judged against. Vision is the means by which\nthe Holy Spirit translates your nightmares into happy dreams; your wild\nhallucinations that show you all the fearful outcomes of imagined sin\ninto the calm and reassuring sights with which He would replace them.\nThese gentle sights and sounds are looked on happily and heard with joy.\nThey are His substitutes for all the terrifying sights and screaming\nsounds the ego’s purpose brought to your horrified awareness. They step\naway from sin, reminding you that it is not reality which frightens you\nand that the errors which you made can be corrected.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> When you have looked on what seemed terrifying and seen it change to\nsights of loveliness and peace; when you have looked on scenes of\nviolence and death and watched them change to quiet views of gardens\nunder open skies, with clear, life-giving water running happily beside\nthem in dancing brooks that never waste away, who need persuade you to\naccept the gift of vision? And after vision, who is there who could\nrefuse what <em>must</em> come after? Think but an instant just on this—you can\nbehold the holiness God gave His Son. And never need you think that\nthere is something else for you to see.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>3</sup> Never forget the world the sightless “see” must be imagined, for what\nit really looks like is unknown to them. They must infer what could be\nseen from evidence forever indirect and reconstruct their inferences as\nthey stumble and fall because of what they did not recognize, or walk\nunharmed through open doorways which they thought were closed. And so it\nis with you. You do not see. Your cues for inference are wrong, and so\nyou stumble and fall down upon the stones you did not recognize, but\nfail to be aware you <em>can</em> go through the doors you thought were closed\nbut which stand open before unseeing eyes, waiting to welcome you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup> How foolish it is to attempt to judge what could be seen instead. It\nis not necessary to imagine what the world must look like. It must be\nseen before you recognize it for what it is. You can be shown which\ndoors are open, and you can see where safety lies and which way leads to\ndarkness, which to light. Judgment will <em>always</em> give you false\ndirections, but vision <em>shows</em> you where to go. Why should you guess?</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> There is no need to learn through pain. And gentle lessons are\nacquired joyously and are remembered gladly. What gives you happiness\nyou <em>want</em> to learn and not forget. It is not this you would deny.\n<em>Your</em> question is whether the means by which this course is learned\nwill <em>bring</em> to you the joy it promises. If you believed it would, the\nlearning of it would be no problem. You are not happy learners yet\nbecause you still remain uncertain that vision gives you <em>more</em> than\njudgment does, and you have learned that <em>both</em> you cannot have.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> The blind become accustomed to their world by their adjustments to it.\nThey think they know their way about in it. They learned it, not through\njoyous lessons, but through the stern necessity of limits they believed\nthey could not overcome. And still believing this, they hold those\nlessons dear and cling to them <em>because</em> they cannot see. They do not\nunderstand the lessons <em>keep</em> them blind. This they do not believe. And\nso they keep the world they learned to “see” in their imagination,\nbelieving that their choice is that or nothing. They hate the world they\nlearned through pain. And everything they think is in it serves to\nremind them that they are incomplete and bitterly deprived.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> Thus they <em>define</em> their life and where they live, adjusting to it as\nthey think they must, afraid to lose the little that they have. And so\nit is with all who see the body as all they have and all their brothers\nhave. They try to reach each other, and they fail and fail again. And\nthey adjust to loneliness, believing that to keep the body is to save\nthe little that they have. Listen and try to think if you remember what\nwe will speak of now.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> Listen—perhaps you catch a hint of an ancient state not quite\nforgotten; dim, perhaps, and yet not altogether unfamiliar, like a song\nwhose name is long forgotten, and the circumstances in which you heard\ncompletely unremembered. Not the whole song has stayed with you, but\njust a little wisp of melody, attached not to a person or a place or\nanything particular. But you remember from just this little part how\nlovely was the song, how wonderful the setting where you heard it, and\nhow you loved those who were there and listened with you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> The notes are nothing. Yet you have kept them with you, not for\nthemselves, but as a soft reminder of what would make you weep if you\nremembered how dear it was to you. You could remember, yet you are\nafraid, believing you would lose the world you learned since then. And\nyet you know that nothing in the world you learned is half so dear as\nthis. Listen and see if you remember an ancient song you knew so long\nago and held more dear than any melody you taught yourself to cherish\nsince.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> Beyond the body, beyond the sun and stars, past everything you see\nand yet somehow familiar, is an arc of golden light that stretches as\nyou look into a great and shining circle. And all the circle fills with\nlight before your eyes. The edges of the circle disappear, and what is\nin it is no longer contained at all. The light expands and covers\neverything, extending to infinity, forever shining and with no break or\nlimit anywhere. Within it everything is joined in perfect continuity.\nNor is it possible to imagine that anything could be outside, for there\nis nowhere that this light is not.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> This is the vision of the Son of God, whom you know well. Here is the\nsight of him who knows his Father. Here is the memory of what you are—a\npart of this, with all of it within and joined to all as surely as all\nis joined in you. Accept the vision which can show you <em>this</em> and not\nthe body. You know the ancient song and know it well. Nothing will ever\nbe as dear to you as is this ancient hymn [of love] the Son of God\nsings to his Father still.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> And now the blind can see, for that same song they sing in honor of\ntheir Creator gives praise to them as well. The blindness which they\nmade will not withstand the memory of this song. And they will look upon\nthe vision of the Son of God, remembering who he is they sing of. What\nis a miracle but this remembering? And who is there in whom this memory\nlies not? The light in one awakens it in all. And when you see it in\neach other, you <em>are</em> remembering for everyone.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>13</sup> We have repeated how little is asked of you to learn this course. It\nis the same small willingness you need to have your whole relationship\ntransformed to joy; the little gift you offer to the Holy Spirit for\nwhich He gives you everything; the very little on which salvation rests;\nthe tiny change of mind by which the crucifixion is changed to\nresurrection. And being true, it is so simple that it cannot fail to be\ncompletely understood. Rejected yes, but <em>not</em> ambiguous. And if you\nchoose against it now, it will not be because it is obscure, but rather\nthat this little cost seemed in your judgment to be too much to pay for\npeace.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> This is the only thing that you need do for vision, happiness,\nrelease from pain, and the complete escape from sin, all to be given\nyou. Say only this, but mean it with no reservations, for here the power\nof salvation lies:</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> <em>I <strong>am</strong> responsible for what I see.<br />\nI chose the feelings I experience, and I decided<br />\non the goal I would achieve.<br />\nAnd everything that seems to happen to me<br />\nI asked for and received as I had asked.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> Deceive yourself no longer that you are helpless in the face of what\nis done to you. Acknowledge but that you have been <em>mistaken</em>, and all\neffects of your mistakes will disappear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> It is impossible the Son of God be merely driven by events outside of\nhim. It is impossible that the happenings that come to him were not his\nchoice. His power of decision is the determiner of every situation in\nwhich he seems to find himself by chance or accident. No accident nor\nchance is possible within the universe as God created it, outside of\nwhich is nothing. Suffer, and you decided sin was your goal. Be happy,\nand you gave the power of decision to Him Who must decide for God for\nyou. This is the little gift you offer to the Holy Spirit, and even this\nHe gave to you to give yourself. For by this gift is given you the power\nto release your savior that he may give salvation unto you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> Begrudge not, then, this little offering. Withhold it, and you keep\nthe world as now you see it. Give it away, and everything you see goes\nwith it. Never was so much given for so little. In the holy instant is\nthis exchange effected and maintained. Here is the world you do not want\nbrought to the one you do. And here the one you do is given you\n<em>because</em> you want it. Yet for this, the power of your wanting must\nfirst be recognized. You must accept its <em>strength</em> and not its\nweakness. You must perceive that what is strong enough to make a world\ncan let it go and can accept correction if it is willing to see that it\nwas wrong.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> The world you see is but the idle witness that you were right. This\nwitness is insane. You trained it in its testimony, and as it gave it\nback to you, you listened and convinced yourself that what it saw was\ntrue. You did this to <em>yourself</em>. See only this, and you will also see\nhow circular the reasoning on which your “seeing” rests. This was not\ngiven you. This was your gift to you and to your brother. Be willing,\nthen, to have it taken from him and be replaced with truth. And as you\nlook upon the change in him, it will be given you to see it in yourself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> Perhaps you do not see the need for you to give this little offering.\nLook closer, then, at what it <em>is</em>. And very simply see in it the whole\nexchange of separation for salvation. All that the ego is, is an idea\nthat it is possible that things should happen to the Son of God\n<em>without</em> his will and thus without the Will of his Creator, Whose Will\ncannot <em>be</em> separate from his own.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> This is the Son of God’s <em>replacement</em> for his will, a mad revolt\nagainst what must forever be. This is the statement that he has the\npower to make God powerless and so to take it for himself and leave\nhimself without what God has willed for him. This is the mad idea you\nhave enshrined upon your altars and which you worship. And anything\nwhich threatens this seems to attack your faith, for here is it\ninvested. Think not that you are faithless, for your belief and trust in\nthis is strong indeed.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> The Holy Spirit can give you faith in holiness and vision to see it\neasily enough. But you have not left open and unoccupied the altar where\nthe gifts belong. Where <em>they</em> should be, you have set up your idols to\nsomething else. This other will, which seems to tell you what must\nhappen, you gave reality. And what would show you otherwise must\ntherefore seem unreal. All that is asked of you is to make room for\ntruth. You are not asked to make or do what lies beyond your\nunderstanding. All you are asked to do is <em>let it in</em>; only to stop your\ninterference with what will happen of itself; simply to recognize again\nthe presence of what you thought you gave away.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> Be willing for an instant to leave your altars free of what you\nplaced upon them, and what is really there you <em>cannot</em> fail to see. The\nholy instant is not an instant of creation but of recognition. For\nrecognition comes of vision and suspended judgment. Then only is it\npossible to look within and see what <em>must</em> be there plainly in sight\nand wholly independent of inference and judgment. Undoing is not your\ntask, but it <em>is</em> up to you to welcome it or not. Faith and desire go\nhand in hand, for everyone believes in what he wants.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> We have already said that wishful thinking is how the ego deals with\nwhat it wants to make it so. There is no better demonstration of the\npower of wanting, and therefore of faith, to make its goals seem real\nand possible. Faith in the unreal leads to adjustments of reality to\nmake it fit the goal of madness. The goal of sin induces the perception\nof a fearful world to justify its purpose. What you desire you <em>will</em>\nsee. And if its reality is false, you will uphold it by not realizing\nall the adjustments you have introduced to make it so.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> When vision is denied, confusion of cause and effect becomes\ninevitable. The purpose now becomes to keep obscure the cause of the\neffect and make effect appear to be a <em>cause</em>. This seeming independence\nof effect enables it to be regarded as standing by itself and capable of\nserving as a cause of the events and feelings its maker thinks it\ncauses. Long ago we spoke of your desire to create your own Creator and\nbe father and not son to Him. This is the same desire. The Son is the\neffect, whose Cause he would deny. And so he seems to <em>be</em> the cause,\nproducing real effects. Nothing can have effects without a cause and to\nconfuse the two is merely to fail to understand them both.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> It is as needful that you recognize you made the world you see as\nthat you recognize that you did not create yourself. <em>They are the same\nmistake</em>. Nothing created not by your Creator has any influence over\nyou. And if you think what you have made can tell you what you see and\nfeel and place your faith in its ability to do so, you are denying your\nCreator and believing that you made yourself. For if you think the world\nyou made has power to make you what it wills, you <em>are</em> confusing Son\nand Father, effect and Source.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> The Son’s creations are like his Father’s. Yet in creating them, the\nSon does not delude himself that he is independent of his Source. His\nunion with It is the Source of his creating. <em>Apart</em> from this he has no\npower to create, and what he makes is meaningless. It changes nothing in\ncreation, depends entirely upon the madness of its maker, and cannot\nserve to justify the madness. Your brother thinks he made the world with\nyou. Thus he denies creation. With you, he thinks the world he made,\nmade him. Thus he <em>denies</em> he made it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> Yet the truth is you were both created by a loving Father Who created\nyou together and as one. See what “proves” otherwise, and you deny your\nwhole reality. But grant that everything which seems to stand between\nyou, keeping you from each other and separate from your Father, you made\nin secret, and the instant of release has come to you. All its effects\nare gone because its source has been uncovered. It is its seeming\nindependence of its source that kept you prisoner. This is the same\ndelusion that you are independent of the Source by which you were\ncreated and have never left.</p>\n\n",

For they are\nbargains with reality, toward which the seeming union is adjusted.\nForget not this—to bargain is to set a limit, and any brother with whom\nyou have a limited relationship <em>you hate</em>. You may attempt to keep the\nbargain in the name of “fairness,” sometimes demanding payment of\nyourself, perhaps more often of the other. Thus in the “fairness” you\nattempt to ease the guilt that comes from the accepted purpose of the\nrelationship. And that is why the Holy Spirit must change its purpose to\nmake it useful to <em>Him</em> and harmless unto <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> If you accept this change, you have accepted the idea of making room\nfor truth. The <em>source</em> of sin is gone. You may imagine that you still\nexperience its effects, but it is not your purpose, and you no longer\n<em>want</em> it. No one allows a purpose to be replaced while he desires it,\nfor nothing is so cherished and protected as is a goal the mind accepts.\nThis it will follow, grimly or happily, but always with faith and with\nthe persistence that faith inevitably brings. The power of faith is\n<em>never</em> recognized if it is placed in sin. But it is <em>always</em> recognized\nif it is placed in love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> Why is it strange to you that faith can move mountains? This is\nindeed a little feat for such a power. For faith can keep the Son of God\nin chains as long as he believes he <em>is</em> in chains. And when he is\nreleased from them, it will be simply because he no longer believes in\nthem, withdrawing faith that they can hold him and placing it in his\nfreedom instead. It is impossible to place equal faith in opposite\ndirections. What faith you give to sin you <em>take away</em> from holiness.\nAnd what you offer holiness has been <em>removed</em> from sin.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> Faith and belief and vision are the means by which the goal of\nholiness is reached. Through them the Holy Spirit leads you to the real\nworld and away from all illusions where your faith was laid. This is His\ndirection, the only one He ever sees. And when you wander, He reminds\nyou there <em>is</em> but one. His faith and His belief and vision are all for\nyou. And when you have accepted them completely instead of yours, you\nwill have need of them no longer. For faith and vision and belief are\nmeaningful only <em>before</em> the state of certainty is reached. In Heaven\nthey are unknown. Yet Heaven is reached through them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> It is impossible that the Son of God lack faith, but he can choose\nwhere he would have it <em>be</em>. Faithlessness is not a <em>lack</em> of faith, but\nfaith in <em>nothing</em>. Faith given to illusions does not lack power, for by\nit does the Son of God believe that he is powerless. Thus is he\nfaithless to himself, but strong in faith in his illusions <em>about</em>\nhimself. For faith, perception, and belief <em>you</em> made as means for\nlosing certainty and finding sin. This mad direction was your choice,\nand by your faith in what you chose, you made what you desired.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> The Holy Spirit has a use for all the means for sin by which you\nsought to find it. But as He uses them, they lead <em>away</em> from sin\nbecause His purpose lies in the opposite direction. He sees the <em>means</em>\nyou use but not the <em>purpose</em> for which you made them. He would not take\nthem from you, for He sees their value as a means for what <em>He</em> wills\nfor you. You made perception that you might choose among your brothers\nand seek for sin with them. The Holy Spirit sees perception as a means\nto teach you that the vision of a holy relationship is all you <em>want</em> to\nsee. Then will you give your faith to holiness, desiring and believing\nin it <em>because</em> of your desire.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> Faith and belief become attached to vision, as all the means that\nonce served sin are redirected now toward holiness. For what you think\nis sin is <em>limitation</em>, and whom you try to limit to the body you hate\nbecause you fear. In your refusal to forgive him, you would condemn him\nto the body because the means for sin are dear to you. And so the body\nhas your faith and your belief. But holiness would set your brother\nfree, removing hatred by removing fear, not as a symptom, but at its\nsource.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> Those who would free their brothers from the body can <em>have</em> no fear.\nThey have renounced the means for sin by choosing to let all limitations\nbe removed. Desiring to look upon their brothers in holiness, the power\nof belief and faith goes far beyond the body, <em>supporting</em> vision, not\nobstructing it. But first they chose to recognize how much their faith\nhad limited their understanding of the world, desiring to place its\npower elsewhere should another point of view be given them. The miracles\nwhich follow this decision are also born of faith. For all who choose to\nlook away from sin are given vision and are led to holiness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> Those who believe in sin <em>must</em> think the Holy Spirit asks for\nsacrifice, for this is how they think <em>their</em> purpose is accomplished.\nBrothers, the Holy Spirit knows that sacrifice brings <em>nothing</em>. He\nmakes no bargains. And if you seek to limit Him, you will hate Him\nbecause you are afraid. The gift that He has given you is more than\nanything that stands this side of Heaven. The instant for its\nrecognition is at hand. Join your awareness to what has been <em>already</em>\njoined. The faith you give each other can accomplish this. For He Who\nloves the world is seeing it for you without one spot of sin upon it and\nin the innocence which makes the sight of it as beautiful as Heaven.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> Your faith in sacrifice has given it great power in your sight,\nexcept you do not realize you cannot see <em>because</em> of it. For sacrifice\nmust be exacted of a body and by another body. The mind could neither\nask it nor receive it of itself. And no more could the body. The\nintention is in the mind, which tries to use the body to carry out the\nmeans for sin in which the <em>mind</em> believes. Thus is the joining of mind\nand body an inescapable belief of those who value sin. And so is\nsacrifice invariably a means for limitation and thus for hate.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> Think you the Holy Spirit is concerned with <em>this</em>? He gives not what\nit is His purpose to lead you <em>from</em>. You think He would deprive you for\nyour good. But “good” and “deprivation” are opposites and cannot\nmeaningfully join in any way. It is like saying that the moon and sun\nare one because they come with night and day, and so they <em>must</em> be\njoined. Yet sight of one is but the sign the other has disappeared from\nsight. Nor is it possible that what gives light be one with what depends\non darkness to be seen. Neither demands the sacrifice of the other. Yet\non the <em>absence</em> of the other does each depend.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> The body was made to be a sacrifice to sin, and in the darkness so it\nstill is seen. Yet in the light of vision, it is looked upon quite\ndifferently. You <em>can</em> have faith in it to serve the Holy Spirit’s goal\nand give it power to serve as means to help the blind to see. But in\ntheir seeing, they look <em>past</em> it, as do you. The faith and the belief\nyou gave it <em>belongs</em> beyond. You gave perception and belief and faith\nfrom mind to body. Let them now be given back to what produced them and\ncan use them still to save itself from what it made.</p>\n\n",

You are indeed afraid to\nlook within and see the sin you think is there. This you would not be\nfearful to admit. Fear in association with sin the ego deems quite\nappropriate and smiles approvingly. It has no fear to let you feel\nashamed. It doubts not your belief and faith in sin. Its temples do not\nshake because of this. Your faith that sin is there but witnesses to\nyour desire that it <em>be</em> there to see. This merely seems to be the\nsource of fear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> Remember that the ego is not alone. Its rule <em>is</em> tempered, and its\nunknown “enemy,” Whom it cannot even see, it fears. Loudly the ego tells\nyou not to look inward, for if you do, your eyes will light on sin, and\nGod will strike you blind. This you believe, and so you do not look. Yet\nthis is not the ego’s hidden fear, nor yours who serve it. Loudly indeed\nthe ego claims it is—<em>too</em> loudly and <em>too</em> often. For underneath this\nconstant shout and frantic proclamation, the ego is not certain it is\nso. Beneath your fear to look within because of sin is yet another fear\nand one which makes the ego tremble.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> What if you looked within and saw <em>no</em> sin? This “fearful” question\nis one the ego <em>never</em> asks. And you who ask it now are threatening the\nego’s whole defensive system too seriously for it to bother to pretend\nit is your friend. Those who have joined their brothers <em>have</em> detached\nthemselves from their belief that their identity lies in the ego. A holy\nrelationship is one in which you join with what is part of you in\n<em>truth</em>. And your belief in sin has been <em>already</em> shaken, nor are you\nnow entirely unwilling to look within and see it not.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> Your liberation still is only partial—still limited and incomplete,\nyet born within you. Not wholly mad, you have been willing to look on\nmuch of your insanity and recognize its madness. Your faith is moving\ninward, past insanity and on to reason. And what your reason tells you\nnow, the ego would not hear. The Holy Spirit’s purpose was accepted by\nthe part of your mind the ego knows not of. No more did <em>you</em>. And yet\nthis part with which you now identify is not afraid to look upon itself.\nIt <em>knows</em> no sin. How, otherwise, could it have been willing to see the\nHoly Spirit’s purpose as its own?</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> This part has seen your brother and recognized him perfectly since\ntime began. And it desired nothing but to join with him and to be free\nagain, as once it was. It has been waiting for the birth of freedom, the\nacceptance of release to come to you. And now you recognize that it was\nnot the ego that joined the Holy Spirit’s purpose, and so there <em>must</em>\nbe something else. Think not that <em>this</em> is madness. For this your\n<em>reason</em> tells you, and it follows perfectly from what you have already\nlearned.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> There is no inconsistency in what the Holy Spirit teaches. This is\nthe reasoning of the <em>sane</em>. You have perceived the ego’s madness and\nnot been made afraid because you did not choose to share in it. At times\nit still deceives you. Yet in your saner moments, its ranting strikes no\nterror in your hearts. For you have realized that all the gifts it would\nwithdraw from you in rage at your “presumptuous” wish to look within,\nyou do not <em>want</em>. A few remaining trinkets still seem to shine and\ncatch your eye. Yet you would not “sell” Heaven to have them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> And now the ego <em>is</em> afraid. Yet what it hears in terror, the other\npart hears as the sweetest music—the song it longed to hear since first\nthe ego came into your minds. The ego’s weakness is its strength. The\nsong of freedom, which sings the praises of another world, brings to it\nhope of peace. For it <em>remembers</em> Heaven, and now it sees that Heaven\nhas come to earth at last, from which the ego’s rule has kept it out so\nlong. Heaven has come because it found a home in your relationship on\nearth. And earth can hold no longer what has been given Heaven as its\nown.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> Look gently on each other and remember the ego’s weakness is revealed\nin both your sight. What it would keep apart has met and joined, and\nlooks upon the ego unafraid. Little children, innocent of sin, follow in\ngladness the way to certainty. Be not held back by fear’s insane\ninsistence that sureness lies in doubt. This has no meaning. What\nmatters it to you how loudly it is proclaimed? The senseless is not made\nmeaningful by repetition and by clamor. The quiet way is open. Follow it\nhappily and question not what must be so.</p>\n\n",

The laws of size and shape and brightness would\nhold, perhaps, if other things were equal. They are <em>not</em> equal. For\nwhat you look for, you are far more likely to discover than what you\nwould prefer to overlook. The still small Voice for God is not drowned\nout by all the ego’s raucous screams and senseless ravings to those who\n<em>want</em> to hear it. Perception is a <em>choice</em> and not a fact. But on this\nchoice depends far more than you may realize as yet. For on the voice\nyou choose to hear and on the sights you choose to see, depends entirely\nyour whole belief in what you <em>are</em>. Perception is a witness but to this\nand <em>never</em> to reality. Yet it can show you the conditions in which\nawareness of reality is possible or those where it could never be.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> Reality needs no cooperation from you to be itself. But your\nawareness of it needs your help because it is your choice. Listen to\nwhat the ego says and see what it directs you see, and it is sure that\nyou will see yourself as tiny, vulnerable, and afraid. You will\nexperience depression, a sense of worthlessness, and feelings of\nimpermanence and unreality. You will believe that you are helpless prey\nto forces far beyond your own control and far more powerful than you.\nAnd you will think the world you made directs your destiny. For this\nwill be your <em>faith</em>. But never believe because it is your faith it\nmakes reality.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> There is another vision and another Voice in which your freedom lies\nawaiting but your choice. And if you place your faith in them, you will\nperceive another Self in you. This other Self sees miracles as natural.\nThey are as simple and natural to It as breathing to the body. They are\nthe obvious response to calls for help, the only one It makes. Miracles\nseem unnatural to the ego because it does not understand how separate\nminds can influence each other. Nor <em>could</em> they do so. But minds cannot\n<em>be</em> separate. This other Self is perfectly aware of this. And thus It\nrecognizes that miracles do not affect another’s mind, only Its own.\n[They always change <em>your</em> mind.] There <em>is</em> no other.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> You do not realize the whole extent to which the idea of separation\nhas interfered with reason. Reason lies in the other Self you have cut\noff from your awareness. And nothing you have allowed to stay in it is\ncapable of reason. How can the segment of the mind devoid of reason\nunderstand what reason is or grasp the information it would give? All\nsorts of questions may arise in it, but if the basic question stems from\nreason, it will not ask it. Like all that stems from reason, the basic\nquestion is obvious, simple, and remains unasked. But think not reason\ncould not answer it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> God’s plan for your salvation could not have been established without\nyour will and your consent. It must have been accepted by the Son of\nGod, for what God wills for him he <em>must</em> receive. For God wills not\napart from him, nor does the Will of God wait upon time to be\naccomplished. Therefore, what joined the Will of God must be in you\n<em>now</em>, being eternal. You must have set aside a place in which the Holy\nSpirit can abide and where He <em>is</em>. He must have been there since the\nneed for Him arose and was fulfilled in the same instant. Such would\nyour reason tell you if you listened. Yet such is clearly not the ego’s\n“reasoning.” Its alien nature to the ego is proof you will not find the\nanswer there. Yet if it must be so, it must exist. And if it exists for\nyou and has your freedom as the purpose given it, you must be free to\n<em>find</em> it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> God’s plan is simple—never circular and never self-defeating. He has\nno Thoughts except the Self-<em>extending</em>, and in this your will must be\nincluded. Thus, there must be a part of you that knows His Will and\nshares it. It is not meaningful to ask if what must be is so. But it\n<em>is</em> meaningful to ask why you are <em>unaware</em> of what is so, for this\nmust have an answer if the plan of God for your salvation is complete.\nAnd it must <em>be</em> complete because its Source knows not of incompletion.\nWhere would the answer be but in the Source? And where are <em>you</em> but\nthere, where this same answer is? Your Identity, as much a true effect\nof this same Source as is the answer, must therefore be together and the\nsame.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> Oh yes, you know this and more than this alone. Yet any part of\nknowledge threatens dissociation as much as all of it. And all of it\n<em>will</em> come with any part. Here is the part you can accept. What reason\npoints to you can see because the witnesses on its behalf are clear.\nOnly the totally insane can disregard them, and you have gone past this.\nReason is a means which serves the Holy Spirit’s purpose in its own\nright. It is not reinterpreted and redirected from the goal of sin as\nare the others. For reason is beyond the ego’s range of means.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Faith and perception and belief can be misplaced and serve the great\ndeceiver’s needs as well as truth. But reason has no place at all in\nmadness, nor can it be adjusted to fit its end. Faith and belief are\nstrong in madness, guiding perception toward what the mind has valued.\nBut reason enters not at all in this. For the perception would fall away\nat once if reason were applied. There <em>is</em> no reason in insanity, for it\ndepends entirely on reason’s absence. The ego never uses it because it\ndoes not realize that it exists. The partially insane have access to it,\nand only they have need of it. Knowledge does not depend on it, and\nmadness keeps it out.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> The part of mind where reason lies was dedicated by your will in\nunion with your Father’s to the undoing of insanity. Here was the Holy\nSpirit’s purpose accepted and accomplished both at once. Reason is alien\nto insanity, and those who use it have gained a means which <em>cannot</em> be\napplied to sin. Knowledge is far beyond attainment of any kind. But\nreason can serve to open doors you closed against it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> You have come very close to this. Faith and belief have shifted, and\nyou have asked the question which the ego will <em>never</em> ask. Does not\nyour reason tell you now the question must have come from something that\nyou do not know but must belong to you? Faith and belief, upheld by\nreason, cannot fail to lead to changed perception. And in this change is\nroom made way for vision. Vision extends beyond itself, as does the\npurpose which it serves and all the means for its accomplishment.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>59</sup> Reason cannot see sin but <em>can</em> see errors and leads to their\ncorrection. It does not value them, but their correction. Reason will\nalso tell you when you think you sin, you call for help. Yet if you will\nnot accept the help you call for, you will not believe that it is yours\nto give. And so you will not give it, thus <em>maintaining</em> the belief. For\nuncorrected error of any kind deceives you about the power that is in\nyou to <em>make</em> correction. If it can correct and you allow it not to do\nso, you deny it to yourself and to your brother. And if he shares this\nsame belief, you both will think that you are damned. This you could\nspare him and <em>yourself.</em> For reason would not make way for correction\nin you alone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> Correction cannot be accepted or refused by you <em>without</em> your\nbrother. Sin would maintain it can. Yet reason tells you that you cannot\nsee your brother or yourself as sinful and still perceive the other\ninnocent. Who looks upon himself as guilty and sees a sinless world? And\nwho can see a sinful world and look upon himself apart from it? Sin\nwould maintain you must be separate. But reason tells you that this must\nbe wrong. If you are joined, how could it be that you have private\nthoughts? And how could thoughts that enter into what but seems like\nyours alone have no effect at all on what <em>is</em> yours? If minds are\njoined, this is impossible.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> No one can think but for himself, as God thinks not without His Son.\nOnly were both in bodies could this be. Nor could one mind think only\nfor itself unless the body <em>were</em> the mind. For only bodies can be\nseparate and therefore unreal. The home of madness cannot be the home of\nreason. Yet it is easy to leave the home of madness if you see reason.\nYou do not leave insanity by going somewhere else. You leave it simply\nby accepting reason where madness was. Madness and reason see the same\nthings, but it is certain that they look upon them differently.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> Madness is an attack on reason that drives it out of mind and takes\nits place. Reason does not attack but takes the place of madness\nquietly, replacing madness if it be the will of the insane to listen to\nit. But the insane know not their will. For they believe they see the\nbody and let their madness tell them it is real. Reason would be\nincapable of this. And if you would defend the body against your reason,\nyou will not understand the body or yourself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> The body does not separate you from your brother, and if you think it\ndoes, you are insane. But madness has a purpose and believes it also has\nthe means to make its purpose real. To see the body as a barrier between\nwhat reason tells you <em>must</em> be joined must be insane. Nor could you see\nit if you heard the voice of reason. What can there be that stands\nbetween what is continuous? And if there is nothing in between, how can\nwhat enters part be kept away from other parts? Reason would tell you\nthis. But think what you must recognize if it be so.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> If you choose sin instead of healing, you would condemn the Son of\nGod to what can never be corrected. You tell him by your choice that he\nis damned—separate from you and from his Father forever and without a\nhope of safe return. You teach him this, and you will learn of him\n<em>exactly</em> what you taught. For you can teach him only that he is as you\nwould have him, and what you choose he be is but your choice for <em>you</em>.\nYet think not this is fearful. That you are joined to him is but a fact,\nnot an interpretation. How can a fact be fearful unless it disagrees\nwith what you hold more dear than truth? Reason will tell you that this\nfact is your <em>release</em>. Neither your brother nor yourself can be\nattacked alone. But neither can accept a miracle instead <em>without</em> the\nother being blessed by it and healed of pain.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> Reason, like love, would reassure you and seeks not to frighten you.\nThe power to heal the Son of God is given you because he <em>must</em> be one\nwith you. You <em>are</em> responsible for how he sees himself. And reason\ntells you it is given you to change his whole mind, which is one with\nyou, in just an instant. And any instant serves to bring complete\ncorrection of his errors and make him whole. The instant that you choose\nto let <em>yourself</em> be healed, in that same instant is his whole salvation\nseen as complete with yours. Reason is given you to understand that this\nis so. For reason, kind as is the purpose for which it is the means,\nleads steadily away from madness toward the goal of truth. And here you\nwill lay down the burden of denying truth. <em>This</em> is the burden that is\nterrible, and not the truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> That you are joined is your salvation—the gift of Heaven, not the\ngift of fear. Does Heaven seem to be a burden to you? In madness, yes.\nAnd yet what madness sees must be dispelled by reason. Reason assures\nyou Heaven is what you <em>want</em>, and <em>all</em> you want. Listen to Him Who\nspeaks with reason and brings your reason into line with His. Be willing\nto let reason be the means by which He would direct you how to leave\ninsanity behind. Hide not behind insanity in order to escape from\nreason. What madness would conceal, the Holy Spirit still holds out for\neveryone to look upon with gladness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> You <em>are</em> your brother’s savior. He is <em>yours.</em> Reason speaks happily\nindeed of this. This gracious plan was given love by Love. And what Love\nplans is like Itself in this: being united, It would have you learn what\n<em>you</em> must be. And being one with It, it must be given you to give what\nIt has given and gives still. Spend but an instant in the glad\nacceptance of what is given you to give your brother, and learn with him\nwhat has been given <em>both</em> of you. To give is no more blessed than to\nreceive. But neither is it less.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> The Son of God is <em>always</em> blessed as one. And as his gratitude goes\nout to you who blessed him, reason will tell you that it cannot be you\nstand apart from blessing. The gratitude he offers you reminds you of\nthe thanks your Father gives you for completing Him. And here alone does\nreason tell you that you can understand what you must be. Your Father is\nas close to you as is your brother. Yet what is there that could be\nnearer you than is your Self?</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> The power that you have over the Son of God is not a threat to his\nreality. It but <em>attests</em> to it. Where could his freedom lie but in\nhimself if he be free already? And who could bind him but himself if he\ndeny his freedom? God is not mocked; no more His Son can be imprisoned\nsave by his own desire. And it is by his own desire that he is freed.\nSuch is his strength and not his weakness. He <em>is</em> at his own mercy. And\nwhere he chooses to be merciful, there is he free. But where he chooses\nto condemn instead, there is he held a prisoner, waiting in chains his\npardon on himself to set him free.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>70</sup> Do you not see that all your misery comes from the strange belief\nthat you are powerless? Being helpless is the <em>cost</em> of sin.\nHelplessness is sin’s condition—the one requirement that it demands to\nbe believed. Only the helpless <em>could</em> believe in it. Enormity has no\nappeal save to the little. And only those who first believe that they\n<em>are</em> little could see attraction there. Treachery to the Son of God is\nthe defense of those who do not identify with him. And you are for him\nor against him; either you love him or attack him, protect his unity or\nsee him shattered and slain by your attack.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> No one believes the Son of God is powerless. And those who see\nthemselves as helpless <em>must</em> believe that they are not the Son of God.\nWhat can they be <em>except</em> his enemy? And what can they do but envy him\nhis power and by their envy make themselves afraid of it? These are the\ndark ones, silent and afraid, alone and not communicating, fearful the\npower of the Son of God will strike them dead and raising up their\nhelplessness against him. They join the army of the powerless, to wage\ntheir war of vengeance, bitterness, and spite on him to make him one\nwith them. Because they do not know that they <em>are</em> one with him, they\nknow not whom they hate. They are indeed a sorry army, each one as\nlikely to attack his brother or turn upon himself as to remember they\nthought they had a common cause.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> Frantic and loud and strong the dark ones seem to be. Yet they know\nnot their enemy, except they <em>hate</em> him. In hatred they have come\ntogether but have not joined each other. For had they done so, hatred\nwould be impossible. The army of the powerless must be disbanded in the\npresence of strength. Those who are strong are <em>never</em> treacherous\nbecause they have no need to dream of power and to act out their dream.\nHow would an army act in dreams? Any way at all. It could be seen\nattacking anyone with anything. Dreams have no reason in them. A flower\nturns into a poisoned spear, a child becomes a giant, and a mouse roars\nlike a lion. And love is turned to hate as easily. This is no army, but\na madhouse. What seems to be a planned attack is bedlam.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> The army of the powerless is weak indeed. It has no weapons, and it\nhas no enemy. Yes, it can overrun the world and <em>seek</em> an enemy. But it\ncan never find what is not there. Yes, it can <em>dream</em> it found an enemy,\nbut this will shift even as it attacks, so that it runs at once to find\nanother and never comes to rest in victory. And as it runs, it turns\nagainst itself, thinking it caught a glimpse of the great enemy which\nalways eludes its murderous attack by turning into something else. How\ntreacherous does this enemy appear, who changes so it is impossible even\nto recognize him!</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> Yet hate must have a target. There can be no faith in sin without an\nenemy. Who that believes in sin would <em>dare</em> believe he has no enemy?\nCould he admit that no one made him powerless? Reason would surely bid\nhim seek no longer what is not there to find. Yet first he must be\nwilling to perceive a world where it is not. It is not necessary that he\nunderstand <em>how</em> he can see it. Nor should he try. For if he focuses on\nwhat he cannot understand, he will but emphasize his helplessness and\nlet sin tell him that his enemy must be <em>himself</em>. But let him only ask\nhimself these questions, which he must decide to have it done for him:</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> <em>Do I <strong>desire</strong> a world I rule instead of one which rules me?<br />\nDo I <strong>desire</strong> a world where I am powerful instead of helpless?<br />\nDo I <strong>desire</strong> a world in which I have no enemies and cannot sin?<br />\nAnd do I want to see what I denied <strong>because</strong> it is the truth?</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> You have already answered the first three questions but not yet the\nlast. For this one still seems fearful and unlike the others. Yet reason\nwould assure you they are all the same. We said this year would\nemphasize the sameness of things that <em>are</em> the same. This final\nquestion, which is indeed the last you need decide, still seems to hold\na threat the rest have lost for you. And this imagined difference\nattests to your belief that truth may be the enemy you yet may find.\nHere, then, would seem to be the last remaining hope of finding sin and\nnot accepting power.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> Forget not that the choice of truth or sin, power or helplessness, is\nthe choice of whether to attack or heal. For healing comes of power and\nattack of helplessness. Whom you attack you <em>cannot</em> want to heal. And\nwhom you would have healed must be the one you chose to be <em>protected</em>\nfrom attack. And what is this decision but the choice whether to see him\nthrough the body’s eyes or let him be revealed to you through vision?\n<em>How</em> this decision leads to its effects is not your problem. But what\nyou <em>want</em> to see <em>must</em> be your choice. This is a course in <em>cause</em> and\nnot effect.</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> Consider carefully your answer to the last question you have left\nunanswered still. And let your reason tell you that it must <em>be</em>\nanswered and <em>is</em> answered in the other three. And then it will be clear\nto you that, as you look on the effects of sin in any form, all you need\ndo is simply ask yourself,</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> <em>Is this what I would see? Do I</em> <strong><em>want</em></strong> <em>this?</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> This is your <em>one</em> decision; this the condition for what occurs. It\nis irrelevant to <em>how</em> it happens but not to <em>why</em>. You <em>have</em> control\nof this. And if you choose to see a world without an enemy in which you\nare not helpless, the means to see it <em>will</em> be given you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> Why is the final question so important? Reason will tell you why. It\nis the same as are the other three except in <em>time</em>. The others are\ndecisions which can be made and then unmade and made again. But truth is\nconstant and implies a state where vacillations are impossible. You can\ndesire a world you rule which rules you not, and change your mind. You\ncan desire to exchange your helplessness for power, and lose this same\ndesire as a little glint of sin attracts you. And you can want to see a\nsinless world and let an “enemy” tempt you to use the body’s eyes and\nchange what you desire.</p>\n\n<p><sup>82</sup> In content, all the questions <em>are</em> the same. For each one asks if\nyou are willing to exchange the world of sin for what the Holy Spirit\nsees, since it is this the world of sin denies. And therefore those who\nlook on sin are seeing the denial of the real world. Yet the last\nquestion adds the wish for <em>constancy</em> in your desire to see the real\nworld, so the desire becomes the <em>only</em> one you have. By answering the\nfinal question “yes,” you add sincerity to the decisions you have\nalready made to all the rest. For only then have you renounced the\noption to change your mind again. When it is this you do <em>not</em> want, the\nrest <em>are</em> wholly answered.</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> Why do you think you are unsure the others <em>have</em> been answered?\nCould it be necessary they be asked so often, if they had? Until the\nlast decision has been made, the answer is both “yes” and “no.” For you\nhave answered “yes” without perceiving that “yes” <em>must</em> mean “not no.”\nNo one decides against his happiness, but he may do so if he does not\nsee he does it. And if he sees his happiness as ever changing, now this,\nnow that, and now an elusive shadow attached to nothing, he <em>does</em>\ndecide against it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>84</sup> Elusive happiness, or happiness in changing form that shifts with\ntime and place, is an illusion which has no meaning. Happiness <em>must</em> be\nconstant because it is attained by giving up the wish for the\n<em>in</em>constant. Joy cannot be perceived <em>except</em> through constant vision.\nAnd constant vision can be given only those who <em>wish</em> for constancy.\nThe power of the Son of God’s desire remains the proof that he is wrong\nwho sees himself as helpless. Desire what you will, and you <em>will</em> look\non it and think it real. No thought but has the power to release or\nkill. And none can leave the thinker’s mind or leave him unaffected.</p>\n\n",

He may be wrong in what he\nasks, where, and of what. Yet he <em>will</em> ask because desire is a request,\nan asking for, and made by one whom God Himself will never fail to\nanswer. God has already given him all that he <em>really</em> wants. Yet what\nhe is uncertain of, God <em>cannot</em> give.

Here is the great appeal to reason; the awareness of what\nis always there to see, the happiness that could be always yours. Here\nis the constant peace you could experience forever. Here is what denial\nhas denied <em>revealed</em> to you. For here the final question is <em>already</em>\nanswered and what you ask for given. Here is the future <em>now</em>, for time\nis powerless because of your desire for what will never change.

And each one seems to make a different\nerror, and one the other cannot understand. Brothers, it <em>is</em> the same,\nmade by the same, and forgiven for its maker in the same way.</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> The holiness of your relationship forgives you both, undoing the\neffects of what you both believed and saw. And with their going is the\n<em>need</em> for sin gone with them. Who has need for sin? Only the lonely and\nalone who see their brothers different from themselves. It is this\ndifference, seen but not real, that makes the need for sin, not real but\nseen, seem justified. And all this would be real if sin were so. For an\nunholy relationship is based on differences, where each one thinks the\nother has what he has not. They come together, each to complete himself\nand rob the other. They stay until they think there’s nothing left to\nsteal and then move on. And so they wander through a world of strangers\nunlike themselves, living with their bodies perhaps under a common roof\nthat shelters neither—in the same room and yet a world apart.</p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup> A holy relationship starts from a different premise.

    "content": "<p><sup>5</sup> Let reason take another step. If you attack whom God would heal and\nhate the one He loves, then you and your Creator <em>have</em> a different\nwill. Yet if you <em>are</em> his will, what you must then believe is that you\nare not <em>yourself</em>. You can indeed believe this, and you <em>do.</em> And you\n<em>have</em> faith in this and see much evidence on its behalf. And where, you\nwonder, does your strange uneasiness, your sense of being disconnected,\nand your haunting fear of lack of meaning in yourself arise? It is as\nthough you wandered in without a plan of any kind except to wander off,\nfor only that seems certain.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> Yet we have heard a very similar description earlier, but it was not\nof <em>you</em>. And yet this strange idea, which it <em>does</em> accurately\ndescribe, you <em>think</em> is you. Reason would tell you that the world you\nsee through eyes which are not yours <em>must</em> make no sense to you. To\nwhom would vision such as this send back its messages? Surely not you,\nwhose sight is wholly independent of the eyes which look upon the world.\nIf this is not your vision, what can it show to you? The brain cannot\ninterpret what <em>your</em> vision sees. This you would understand. The brain\ninterprets to the body, of which it is a part. But what it says, <em>you</em>\ncannot understand. Yet you have listened to it. And long and hard you\ntried to understand its messages. You did not realize it is impossible\nto understand what fails entirely to reach you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> You have received no messages at all you understand. For you have\nlistened to what can never communicate at all. Think, then, what\nhappened. Denying what you are and firm in faith that you are something\nelse, this “something else” which you have made to be yourself <em>became</em>\nyour sight. Yet it must be the “something else” which sees, and as <em>not</em>\nyou, <em>explains</em> its sight to you. <em>Your</em> vision would, of course, render\nthis quite unnecessary. Yet if your eyes are closed and you have called\nupon this thing to lead you, asking it to explain to you the world it\nsees, you have no reason not to listen nor to suspect that what it tells\nyou is not true. Reason would tell you it cannot be true <em>because</em> you\ndo not understand it. God has no secrets. He does not lead you through a\nworld of misery, waiting to tell you at the journey’s end why He did\nthis to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> What could be secret from God’s Will? Yet you believe that <em>you</em> have\nsecrets. What could your secrets be except <em>another</em> will that is your\nown, apart from His? Reason would tell you that this is no secret that\nneed be hidden as a sin. But a mistake indeed! Let not your fear of sin\nprotect it from correction, for the attraction of guilt is only fear.\nHere is the one emotion that you made, whatever it may seem to be. This\nis the emotion of secrecy, of private thoughts, and of the body. This is\nthe one emotion that opposes love and always leads to sight of\ndifferences and loss of sameness. Here is the one emotion that keeps you\nblind, dependent on the self you think you made to lead you through the\nworld it made for you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> Your sight was given you, along with everything that you can\nunderstand. You will perceive no difficulty in understanding what this\nvision tells you, for everyone sees only what he thinks he <em>is.</em> And\nwhat your sight would show you, you will understand <em>because</em> it is the\ntruth. Only your vision can convey to you what <em>you</em> can see. It reaches\nyou directly without a need to be interpreted to you. What needs\ninterpretation <em>must</em> be alien. Nor will it ever be made understandable\nby an interpreter you cannot understand.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> Of all the messages you have received and failed to understand, this\ncourse alone is <em>open</em> to your understanding and <em>can</em> be understood.\nThis is <em>your</em> language. You do not understand it yet, only because your\nwhole communication is like a baby’s. The sounds a baby makes and what\nhe hears are highly unreliable, meaning different things to him at\ndifferent times. Neither the sounds he hears nor sights he sees are\nstable yet. But what he hears and does not understand will be his native\ntongue, through which he will communicate with those around him, and\nthey with him. And the strange, shifting ones he sees about him will\nbecome to him his comforters, and he will recognize his home and see\nthem there with him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> So in each holy relationship is the ability to communicate instead of\nseparate reborn. Yet a holy relationship, so recently reborn itself from\nan unholy relationship and yet more ancient than the old illusion that\nit has replaced, <em>is</em> like a baby now in its rebirth. Yet in this infant\nis your vision returned to you, and he will speak the language both of\nyou can understand. He is not nurtured by the “something else” you\nthought was you. He was not given there, nor was received by anything\nexcept yourself. For no two people can unite except through Christ,\nWhose vision sees them one.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> Think what is given you, my holy brothers. This child will teach you\nwhat you do not understand and make it plain. For his will be no alien\ntongue. He will need no interpreter to you, for it was you who taught\nhim what he knows <em>because</em> you knew it. He could not come to anyone but\nyou, never to “something else.” Where Christ has entered, no one is\nalone, for never could He find a home in separate ones. Yet must He be\nreborn into His ancient home, so seeming new and yet as old as He, a\ntiny newcomer, dependent on the holiness of your relationship to let Him\nlive.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> Be certain God did not entrust His Son to the unworthy. Nothing but\nwhat is part of Him is worthy of being joined. Nor is it possible that\nanything not part of Him <em>can</em> join. Communication must have been\nrestored to those that join, for this they could not do through bodies.\nWhat, then, has joined them? Reason will tell you that they must have\nseen each other through a vision not of the body and communicated in a\nlanguage the body does not speak. Nor could it be a fearful sight or\nsound that drew them gently into one. Rather, in each the other saw a\nperfect shelter where his Self could be reborn in safety and in peace.\nSuch did his reason tell him; such he believed <em>because</em> it was the\ntruth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> Here is the first direct perception that you have made. You made it\nthrough awareness older than perception and yet reborn in just an\ninstant. For what is time to what was always so? Think what that instant\nbrought—the recognition that the “something else” you thought was you is\nan illusion. And truth came instantly to show you where your Self must\nbe. It is <em>denial</em> of illusions that calls on truth, for to deny\nillusions is to recognize that fear is meaningless. Into the holy home,\nwhere fear is powerless, love enters thankfully, grateful that it is one\nwith you who joined to let it enter.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> Christ comes to what is like Himself; the same, not different. For He\nis always drawn unto Himself. What is as like Him as a holy\nrelationship? And what draws you together draws Him to you. Here are His\nsweetness and His gentle innocence protected from attack. And here can\nHe return in confidence, for faith in one another is always faith in\nHim. You are indeed correct in looking on each other as His chosen home,\nfor here you will with Him and with His Father. This is your Father’s\nWill for you, and yours with His. And who is drawn to Christ is drawn to\nGod as surely as both are drawn to every holy relationship, the home\nprepared for them as earth is turned to Heaven.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>16</sup> The opposite of illusions is not disillusionment, but truth. Only to\nthe ego, to which truth is meaningless, do they appear to be the only\nalternatives and different from each other. In truth they are the same.\nBoth bring the same amount of misery, though each one seems to be the\nway to lose the misery the other brings. Every illusion carries pain and\nsuffering in the dark folds of the heavy garments with which it hides\nits nothingness. Yet in these dark and heavy garments are those who seek\nillusions covered and hidden from the joy of truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> Truth is the opposite of illusions because it offers joy. What else\nbut joy could be the opposite of misery? To leave one kind of misery and\nseek another is hardly an escape. To change illusions is to make no\nchange. The search for joy in misery is senseless, for how could joy be\nfound in misery? All that is possible in the dark world of misery is to\nselect some aspects out of it, see them as different, and define the\ndifference as joy. Yet to perceive a difference where none exists will\nsurely fail to <em>make</em> a difference.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> Illusions carry only guilt and suffering, sickness and death to their\nbelievers. The form in which they are accepted is irrelevant. No form of\nmisery in reason’s eyes can be confused with joy. Joy is eternal. You\ncan be sure indeed that any seeming happiness that does not last is\nreally fear. Joy does not turn to sorrow, for the eternal cannot change.\nBut sorrow <em>can</em> be turned to joy, for time gives way to the eternal.\nOnly the timeless must remain unchanged, but everything in time can\nchange with time. Yet if the change be real and not imagined, illusions\nmust give way to truth and not to other dreams that are but equally\nunreal. This is no difference.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> Reason will tell you that the only way to escape from misery is to\nrecognize it <em>and</em> <em>go the other way</em>. Truth is the same and misery the\nsame, but they <em>are</em> different from each other in every way, in every\ninstance, and without exception. To believe that one exception can exist\nis to confuse what is the same with what is different. <em>One</em> illusion\ncherished and defended against the truth makes <em>all</em> truth meaningless\nand <em>all</em> illusions real. Such is the power of belief. It cannot\ncompromise. And faith in innocence is faith in sin if the belief\nexcludes one living thing and holds it out apart from its forgiveness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> Both reason and the ego will tell you this, but what they <em>make</em> of\nit is not the same. The ego will assure you now that it is impossible\nfor you to see no guilt in anyone. And if this vision is the <em>only</em>\nmeans by which escape from guilt can be attained, then the belief in sin\nmust be eternal. Yet reason looks on this another way, for reason sees\nthe <em>source</em> of an idea as what will make it true or false. This must be\nso if the idea is <em>like</em> its source. Therefore, says reason, if escape\nfrom guilt was given to the Holy Spirit as His purpose, and by One to\nWhom nothing He wills <em>can</em> be impossible, the means for its attainment\nare <em>more</em> than possible. They <em>must</em> be there, and you must <em>have</em>\nthem.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> This is a crucial period in this course, for here the separation of\nyou and the ego must be made complete. For if you <em>have</em> the means to\nlet the Holy Spirit’s purpose be accomplished, they can be <em>used</em>. And\n<em>through</em> their use will you gain faith in them. Yet to the ego this\nmust be impossible, and no one undertakes to do what holds no hope of\never being done. <em>You</em> know what your Creator wills is possible, but\nwhat you made believes it is not so. Now must you choose between\nyourself and an <em>illusion</em> of yourself. <em>Not</em> both, but <em>one</em>. There is\nno point in trying to avoid this one decision. It <em>must</em> be made. Faith\nand belief can fall to either side, but reason tells you that misery\nlies only on one side and joy upon the other.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> Forsake not now each other. For you who are the same will not decide\nalone nor differently. Either you give each other life or death; either\nyou are each other’s savior or his judge, offering him sanctuary or\ncondemnation. This course will be believed entirely or not at all. For\nit is wholly true or wholly false and cannot be but partially believed.\nAnd you will either escape from misery entirely or not at all. Reason\nwill tell you that there is no middle ground where you can pause\nuncertainly, waiting to choose between the joy of Heaven and the misery\nof hell. Until you choose Heaven, you <em>are</em> in hell and misery.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> There is no part of Heaven you can take and weave into illusions. Nor\nis there one illusion you can enter Heaven with. A savior cannot be a\njudge, nor mercy condemnation. And vision cannot damn, but only bless.\nWhose function is to save will save. <em>How</em> he will do it is beyond your\nunderstanding, but <em>when</em> must be your choice. For time you made, and\ntime you <em>can</em> command. You are no more a slave to time than to the\nworld you made.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> Let us look closer at the whole illusion that what you made has power\nto enslave its maker. This is the same belief that caused the\nseparation. It is the meaningless idea that thoughts can leave the\nthinker’s mind, be different from it, and <em>in opposition</em> to it. If this\nwere true, thoughts would not be the mind’s extensions but its enemies.\nAnd here we see again another form of the same fundamental illusion we\nhave seen many times before. Only if it were possible the Son of God\ncould leave his Father’s Mind, make himself different, and oppose His\nWill, would it be possible that the self he made and all it made should\nbe his master.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> Behold the great projection, but look on it with the decision that it\nmust be healed and not with fear. Nothing you made has any power over\nyou unless you still would be apart from your Creator and with a will\nopposed to His. For only if you would believe His Son could be His enemy\ndoes it seem possible that what <em>you</em> made is yours. You would condemn\nHis joy to misery and make Him different. And all the misery you made\nhas been your own. Are you not <em>glad</em> to learn it is not true? Is it not\nwelcome news to hear not one of the illusions that you made replaced the\ntruth?</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> Only <em>your</em> thoughts have been impossible. Salvation <em>cannot</em> be. It\n<em>is</em> impossible to look upon your savior as your enemy and recognize\nhim. Yet it <em>is</em> possible to recognize him for what he is if God would\nhave it so. What God has given to your holy relationship is <em>there</em>. For\nwhat He gave the Holy Spirit to give to you, <em>He gave</em>. Would you not\nlook upon the savior that has been given you? And would you not exchange\nin gratitude the function of an executioner you gave him for the one he\nhas in truth? Receive of him what God has given him for you, not what\nyou tried to give yourself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> Beyond the bodies that you interposed between you and shining in the\ngolden light which reaches it from the bright endless circle that\nextends forever is your holy relationship, beloved of God Himself. How\nstill it rests, in time and yet beyond, immortal yet on earth. How great\nthe power that lies in it. Time waits upon its will, and earth will be\nas it would have it be. Here is no separate will nor the desire that\n<em>anything</em> be separate. Its will has no exceptions, and what it wills is\ntrue. Every illusion brought to its forgiveness is gently overlooked and\ndisappears. For at its center Christ has been reborn to light His home\nwith vision that overlooks the world. Would you not have this holy home\nbe yours as well? No misery is here, but only joy.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> All you need do to dwell in quiet here with Christ is share His\nvision. Quickly and gladly is His vision given to anyone who is but\nwilling to see his brother sinless. And no one can remain beyond this\nwillingness if you would be released entirely from all effects of sin.\nWould you have partial forgiveness for yourself? Can you reach Heaven\nwhile a single sin still tempts you to remain in misery? Heaven is the\nhome of perfect purity, and God created it for <em>you</em>. Look on your holy\nbrother, sinless as yourself, and let him lead you there.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>29</sup> The introduction of reason into the ego’s thought system is the\nbeginning of its undoing. For reason and the ego are contradictory. Nor\nis it possible for them to co-exist in your awareness. And reason’s goal\nis to make plain and therefore obvious. You can <em>see</em> reason. This is\nnot a play on words, for here is the beginning of a vision that has\nmeaning. Vision is sense, quite literally. If it is not the body’s\nsight, it <em>must</em> be understood. For it is <em>plain</em>, and what is obvious\nis not ambiguous. It <em>can</em> be understood. And here do reason and the ego\nseparate to go their different ways.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> The ego’s whole continuance depends on its belief you cannot learn\nthis course. Share this belief, and reason will be unable to see your\nerrors and make way for their correction. For reason sees <em>through</em>\nerrors, telling you what you thought was real is not. Reason can see the\ndifference between sin and mistakes because it <em>wants</em> correction.\nTherefore, it tells you what you thought was uncorrectable <em>can</em> be\ncorrected, and thus it must have been an error. The ego’s opposition to\ncorrection leads to its fixed belief in sin and disregard of errors. It\nlooks on <em>nothing</em> that can be corrected. Thus does the ego damn and\nreason save.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> Reason is not salvation in itself, but it makes way for peace and\nbrings you to a state of mind in which salvation can be given you. Sin\nis a block, set like a heavy gate, locked and without a key, across the\nroad to peace. No one who looks on it without the help of reason would\ntry to pass it. The body’s eyes behold it as solid granite, so thick it\nwould be madness to attempt to pass it. Yet reason sees through it\neasily <em>because</em> it is an error. The form it takes cannot conceal its\nemptiness from reason’s eyes.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> <em>Only</em> the form of error attracts the ego. Meaning it does not\nrecognize and does not know if it is there or not. Everything which the\nbody’s eyes can see is a mistake, an error in perception, a distorted\nfragment of the whole, without the meaning that the whole would give.\nAnd yet mistakes, regardless of their form, can be corrected. Sin is but\nerror in a special form the ego venerates. It would preserve all errors\nand make them sins. For here is its own stability, its heavy anchor in\nthe shifting world it made—the rock on which its church is built and\nwhere its worshipers are bound to bodies and believe the body’s freedom\nis their own.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> Reason will tell you that the form of error is not what makes it a\nmistake. If what the form <em>conceals</em> is a mistake, the form cannot\nprevent correction. The body’s eyes see <em>only</em> form. They cannot see\nbeyond what they were <em>made</em> to see. And they were made to look on error\nand not see past it. Theirs is indeed a strange perception, for they can\nsee only illusions, unable to look beyond the granite block of sin and\nstopping at the outside form of nothing. To this distorted form of\nvision, the outside of everything, the wall that stands between you and\nthe truth, is wholly true. Yet how can sight which stops at nothingness\nas if it were a solid wall see truly? It is held back by form, having\nbeen made to guarantee that nothing else but form will be perceived.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> These eyes, made <em>not</em> to see, will <em>never</em> see. For the idea they\nrepresent left not its maker, and it is their maker that sees through\nthem. What was its maker’s <em>goal</em> but not to see? For this the body’s\neyes are perfect means, but not for <em>seeing</em>. See how the body’s eyes\nrest on externals and cannot go beyond. Watch how they stop at\nnothingness, unable to go beyond the form to meaning. Nothing so\nblinding as perception of form. For sight of form means understanding\nhas been obscured.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> Only <em>mistakes</em> have different forms, and so they can deceive. You\ncan change form <em>because</em> it is not true. It could not be reality,\n<em>because</em> it can be changed. Reason will tell you that, if form is not\nreality, it must be an illusion and is not <em>there</em> to see. And if you\nsee it, you must be mistaken, for you are seeing what can <em>not</em> be real\nas if it <em>were</em>. What cannot see beyond what is not there <em>must</em> be\ndistorted perception and must perceive illusions as the truth. Could it\nthen <em>recognize</em> the truth?</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> Let not the <em>form</em> of his mistakes keep you from him whose holiness\nis yours. Let not the vision of his holiness, the sight of which would\nshow you your forgiveness, be kept from you by what the body’s eyes can\nsee. Let your awareness of your brother not be blocked by your\nperception of his sins and of his body. What is there in him that you\nwould attack except what you associate with his body, which <em>you</em>\nbelieve can sin? Beyond his errors is <em>his</em> holiness and <em>your</em>\nsalvation. You gave him not his holiness but tried to see your sins in\nhim to save yourself. And yet his holiness <em>is</em> your forgiveness. Can\n<em>you</em> be saved by making sinful the one whose holiness is your\nsalvation?</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> A holy relationship, however newly born, must value holiness above\nall else. Unholy values will produce confusion, and in <em>awareness</em>. In\nan unholy relationship, each one is valued because he seems to justify\nthe other’s sin. He sees within the other what impels him to sin against\nhis will. And thus he lays his sins upon the other and is attracted to\nhim to <em>perpetuate</em> his sins. And so it must become impossible for each\nto see himself as <em>causing</em> sin by his desire to have sin real. Yet\nreason sees a holy relationship as what it is—a common state of mind,\nwhere both give errors gladly to correction that both may happily be\nhealed as one.</p>\n\n",

No one who reaches this\nfar <em>can</em> make the wrong decision, but he <em>can</em> delay.

Think what will happen after!\nThe love of Christ will light your faces and shine from them into a\ndarkened world that <em>needs</em> the light. And from this holy place He will\nreturn with you, not leaving it nor you. You will become His messengers,\nreturning Him unto Himself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> Think of the loveliness that you will see who walk with Him! And\nthink how beautiful will each of you look to the other! How happy you\nwill be to be together after such a long and lonely journey where you\nwalked alone. The gates of Heaven, open now for you, will you now open\nto the sorrowful. And none who looks upon the Christ in you but will\nrejoice. How beautiful the sight you saw beyond the veil which you will\nbring to light the tired eyes of those as weary now as once you were.\nHow thankful will they be to see you come among them, offering Christ’s\nforgiveness to dispel their faith in sin.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> Every mistake you make the other will gently have corrected for you,\nfor in his sight your loveliness is his salvation which he would protect\nfrom harm. And each will be the other’s strong protector from everything\nthat seems to rise between you. So shall you walk the world with me,\nwhose message has not yet been given to everyone. For you are here to\nlet it be <em>received</em>. God’s offer still is open, yet it waits\nacceptance. From you who have accepted it is it received. Into your\njoined hands is it safely given, for you who share it have become its\nwilling guardians and protectors.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> To all who share the love of God, the grace is given to be the givers\nof what they have received. And so they learn that it is theirs forever.\nAll barriers disappear before their coming, as every obstacle was\nfinally surmounted which seemed to rise and block their way before. This\nveil you lift together opens the way to truth to more than you.

Merely by letting reason tell you that they\n<em>contradict</em> reality. They go against what must be true. The opposition\ncomes from them and not reality. Reality opposes nothing. What merely\n<em>is</em> needs no defense and offers none. Only illusions need defense\nbecause of weakness. And how can it be difficult to walk the way of\ntruth when only weakness interferes? <em>You</em> are the strong ones in this\nseeming conflict. And you need no defense. Everything that needs defense\nyou do not want, for anything that needs defense will <em>weaken</em> you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> Consider what the ego wants defenses <em>for</em>—always to justify what\ngoes against the truth, flies in the face of reason, and makes no sense.\nCan this <em>be</em> justified? What can this be except an invitation to\ninsanity to save you from the truth? And what would you be saved from\nbut what you fear? Belief in sin needs great defense and at enormous\ncost. All that the Holy Spirit offers must be defended against and\nsacrificed. For sin is carved into a block out of your peace and laid\nbetween you and its return. Yet how can peace be so fragmented? It is\nstill whole, and nothing has been taken from it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> See how the means and the material of evil dreams are nothing. In\ntruth you stand together with nothing in between. God holds your hands,\nand what can separate whom He has joined as one with Him? It is your\nFather Whom you would defend against. Yet it remains impossible to keep\nlove out. God rests with you in quiet, undefended and wholly\nundefending, for in this quiet state alone is strength and power. Here\ncan no weakness enter, for here is no attack and therefore no illusions.\nLove rests in certainty. Only uncertainty can be defensive. And all\nuncertainty is doubt about <em>yourself</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> How weak is fear—how little and how meaningless! How insignificant\nbefore the quiet strength of those whom love has joined! This is your\n“enemy”—a frightened mouse that would attack the universe. How likely is\nit that it will succeed? Can it be difficult to disregard its feeble\nsqueaks that tell of its omnipotence and would drown out the hymn of\npraise to its Creator which every heart throughout the universe forever\nsings as one? Which is the stronger? Is it this tiny mouse or everything\nthat God created? You are not joined together by this mouse but by the\nWill of God. And can a mouse betray whom God has joined?</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> If you but recognized how little stands between you and your\nawareness of your union! Be not deceived by the illusions it presents of\nsize and thickness, weight, solidity, and firmness of foundation. Yes,\nto the body’s eyes it looks like an enormous solid body, immovable as is\na mountain. Yet within you there is a Force which no illusions can\nresist. This body only seems to be immovable; this Force is irresistible\nin truth. What, then, must happen when they come together? Can the\nillusion of immovability be long defended from what is quietly passed\nthrough and gone beyond?</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> Forget not, when you feel the need arise to be defensive about\nanything, you have identified yourself with an illusion. And therefore\nfeel that you are weak because you are alone. This is the cost of <em>all</em>\nillusions. Not one but rests on the belief that you are separate. Not\none that does not seem to stand, heavy and solid and immovable, between\nyou and your brother. And not one that truth cannot pass over lightly\nand so easily that you must be convinced, in spite of what you thought\nit was, that it is nothing. If you forgive each other, this <em>must</em>\nhappen.

And one must serve the other and lead to its\npredominance, increasing its importance by diminishing its own. Means\nserve the end, and as the end is reached, the value of the means\ndecreases, eclipsed entirely when they are recognized as functionless.\nNo one but yearns for freedom and tries to find it. Yet he will seek for\nit where he believes it is and can be found. He will believe it possible\nof mind or body, and he will make the other serve his choice as means to\nfind it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> Where freedom of the body has been chosen, the mind is used as means\nwhose value lies in its ability to contrive ways to achieve the body’s\nfreedom. Yet freedom of the body has no meaning, and so the mind is\ndedicated to serve illusions. This is a situation so contradictory and\nso impossible that anyone who chooses this has no idea of what <em>is</em>\nvaluable. Yet even in this confusion, so profound it cannot be\ndescribed, the Holy Spirit waits in gentle patience, as certain of the\noutcome as He is sure of His Creator’s love. He knows this mad decision\nwas made by one as dear to His Creator as love is to itself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> Be not disturbed at all to think how He can change the role of means\nand end so easily in what God loves and would have free forever. But be\nyou rather grateful that <em>you</em> can be the means to serve His end. This\nis the only service which leads to freedom. To serve this end, the body\nmust be perceived as sinless because the <em>goal</em> is sinlessness. The lack\nof contradiction makes the soft transition from means to end as easy as\nis the shift from hate to gratitude before forgiving eyes. You <em>will</em> be\nsanctified by one another, using your bodies only to serve the sinless.\nAnd it <em>will</em> be impossible for you to hate what serves what you would\nheal.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> This holy relationship, lovely in its innocence, mighty in strength,\nand blazing with a light far brighter than the sun which lights the sky\nyou see, is chosen of your Father as a means for His own plan. Be\nthankful that it serves yours not at all. Nothing entrusted to it can be\nmisused, and nothing given it but will be used. This holy relationship\nhas the power to heal all pain, regardless of its form. Neither of you\nalone can serve at all. Only in your joint will does healing lie. For\nhere <em>your</em> healing is and here will you accept Atonement. And in your\nhealing is the Sonship healed <em>because</em> your wills are joined.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> Before a holy relationship there is no sin. The form of error is no\nlonger seen, and reason, joined with love, looks quietly on all\nconfusion, observing merely, “This was a mistake.” And then the same\nAtonement you accepted in your relationship corrects the error and lays\na part of Heaven in its place. How blessed are you who let this gift be\ngiven! Each part of Heaven that you bring is given <em>you</em>. And every\nempty place in Heaven that you fill again with the Eternal Light you\nbring shines now on <em>you</em>. The means of sinlessness can know no fear\nbecause they carry only love with them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Children of peace, the light <em>has</em> come to you. The light you bring\nyou do not recognize, and yet you will remember. Who can deny himself\nthe vision that he brings to others? And who would fail to recognize a\ngift he let be laid in Heaven through himself? The gentle service that\nyou give the Holy Spirit is service to yourself. You who are now His\nmeans must love all that He loves. And what you bring is your\nremembrance of everything that is eternal. No trace of anything in time\ncan long remain in minds that serve the timeless. And no illusion can\ndisturb the peace of a relationship which has become the means of peace.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> When you have looked upon each other with complete forgiveness from\nwhich no error is excluded and nothing kept hidden what mistake can\nthere be anywhere you cannot overlook? What form of suffering could\nblock your sight, preventing you from seeing past it? And what illusion\ncould there be you will not recognize as a mistake—a shadow through\nwhich you walk completely undismayed? God would let nothing interfere\nwith those whose wills are His[. And they will recognize their wills\nare His, <em>because</em> they serve His Will] and serve it willingly. And\n<em>could</em> remembrance of what they are be long delayed?</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> You will see your value through each other’s eyes, and each one is\nreleased as he beholds his savior in place of the attacker who he\nthought was there. Through this releasing is the world released. This is\nyour part in bringing peace. For you have asked what is your function\nhere and have been answered. Seek not to change it nor to substitute\nanother goal. [This one was <em>given</em> you and <em>only</em> this.] Accept this\none and serve it willingly, for what the Holy Spirit does with the gifts\nyou give each other, to whom He offers them, and where and when is up to\nHim. He will bestow them where they are received and welcomed. He will\nuse every one of them for peace. Nor will one little smile or\nwillingness to overlook the tiniest mistake be lost to anyone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> What can it be but universal blessing to look on what your Father\nloves with charity? Extension of forgiveness is the Holy Spirit’s\nfunction. Leave this to Him. Let your concern be only that you give to\nHim that which can <em>be</em> extended. Save no dark secrets that He cannot\nuse, but offer Him the tiny gifts He can extend forever. He will take\neach one and make of it a potent force for peace. He will withhold no\nblessing from it nor limit it in any way. He will join to it all the\npower that God has given Him to make each little gift of love a source\nof healing for everyone. Each little gift you offer to the other lights\nup the world. Be not concerned with darkness; look away from it and\ntoward each other. And let the darkness be dispelled by Him Who knows\nthe light and lays it gently in each quiet smile of faith and confidence\nwith which you bless each other.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> On your learning depends the welfare of the world. And it is only\narrogance that would deny the power of your will. Think you the Will of\nGod is powerless? Is this humility? You do not see what this belief has\ndone. You see yourself as vulnerable, frail, and easily destroyed and at\nthe mercy of countless attackers more powerful than you. Let us look\nstraight at how this error came about, for here lies buried the heavy\nanchor that seems to keep the fear of God in place, unmovable and solid\nas a rock. While this remains, so will it seem to be.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> Who can attack the Son of God and <em>not</em> attack his Father? How can\nGod’s Son be weak and frail and easily destroyed <em>unless</em> his Father is?\nYou do not see that every sin and every condemnation which you perceive\nand justify <em>is</em> an attack upon your Father. And that is why it has not\nhappened nor <em>could</em> be real. You do not see that this is your attempt\nbecause you think the Father and the Son are separate. And you <em>must</em>\nthink that they are separate because of fear. For it seems safer to\nattack another or yourself than to attack the great Creator of the\nuniverse, whose power you <em>know.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> If you were one with God and <em>recognized</em> this oneness, you would\nknow His power is <em>yours</em>. But you will not remember this while you\nbelieve attack of any kind means anything. It is unjustified in any form\n<em>because</em> it has no meaning. The only way it could be justified is if\neach one of you were separate from the other, and all were separate from\nyour Creator. For only then would it be possible to attack a part of the\ncreation without the whole, the Son without the Father, and to attack\nanother without yourself or hurt yourself without the other feeling\npain. And this belief you <em>want</em>. Yet wherein lies its value except in\nthe desire to attack in safety? Attack is neither safe nor dangerous. It\nis <em>impossible</em>. And this is so <em>because</em> the universe is one. You would\nnot choose attack on its reality if it were not essential to attack to\nsee it [<em>separate from its Creator</em>]. And thus it seems as if love\ncould attack and become fearful.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> Only the <em>different</em> can attack. So you conclude <em>because</em> you can\nattack you <em>must</em> be different. Yet does the Holy Spirit explain this\ndifferently. <em>Because</em> you are not different, you <em>cannot</em> attack.\nEither position is a logical conclusion if only the different can\nattack. Either could be maintained, but never both. The only question to\nbe answered to decide which must be true is whether you <em>are</em> different.\nFrom the position of what you understand, you seem to be and therefore\ncan attack. Of the alternatives, this seems more natural and more in\nline with your experience. And therefore it is necessary that you have\nother experiences more in line with truth to teach you what <em>is</em> natural\nand true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> This is the function of your holy relationship. For what one thinks\nthe other will experience with him. What can this mean <em>except</em> your\nminds are one? Look not with fear upon this happy fact and think not\nthat it lays a heavy burden on you. For when you have accepted it with\ngladness, you will realize that your relationship is a reflection of the\nunion of the Creator and His Son. From loving minds there <em>is</em> no\nseparation. And every thought in one brings gladness to the other\n<em>because</em> they are the same. Joy is unlimited because each shining\nthought of love extends its being and creates more of itself. There is\nno difference anywhere in it, for every thought is like itself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> The light that joins you shines throughout the universe, and because\nit joins you, so it makes you one with your Creator. And in Him is all\ncreation joined. Would you regret you cannot fear alone when your\nrelationship can also teach the power of love is there, which makes all\nfear impossible? Do not attempt to keep a little of the ego with this\ngift. For it was given you to be <em>used</em> and not obscured. What teaches\nyou you cannot separate, <em>denies</em> the ego. Let truth decide if you be\ndifferent or the same and teach you which <em>is</em> true.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>7</sup> The memory of God comes to the quiet mind. It cannot come where there\nis conflict, for a mind at war against itself remembers not eternal\ngentleness. The means of war are not the means of peace, and what the\nwarlike would remember is not love. War is impossible unless belief in\nvictory is cherished. Conflict within you must imply that you believe\nthe ego has the power to <em>be</em> victorious. Why else would you identify\nwith it? Surely you realize the ego is at war with God. Certain it is it\nhas no enemy. Yet just as certain is its fixed belief it <em>has</em> an enemy\nthat it must overcome and <em>will</em> succeed.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> Do you not realize a war against yourself would <em>be</em> a war on God? Is\nvictory conceivable? And if it were, is this a victory that you would\n<em>want</em>? The death of God, if it were possible, would be <em>your</em> death. Is\nthis a <em>victory</em>? The ego <em>always</em> marches to defeat because it thinks\nthat triumph over you is possible. And God thinks otherwise. This is no\nwar—only the mad belief the Will of God can be attacked and overthrown.\nYou may <em>identify</em> with this belief, but never will it be more than\nmadness. And fear will reign in madness and will seem to have replaced\nlove there. This is the conflict’s <em>purpose.</em> And to those who think\nthat it is possible, the means seem real.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> Be certain that it is impossible God and the ego, or yourself and it,\nwill <em>ever</em> meet. You <em>seem</em> to meet and make your strange alliances on\ngrounds that have no meaning. For your beliefs converge upon the body,\nthe ego’s chosen home, which you believe is <em>yours</em>. You meet at a\nmistake—an error in your self-appraisal. The ego joins with an illusion\nof yourself you <em>share</em> with it. And yet illusions cannot join. They are\nthe same, and they are nothing. Their joining lies in nothingness; two\nare as meaningless as one or as a thousand. The ego joins with nothing,\n<em>being</em> nothing. The victory it seeks is meaningless as is itself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> Brothers, the war against yourself is almost over. The journey’s end\nis at the place of peace. Would you not now accept the peace offered you\nhere? This “enemy” you fought as an intruder on your peace is here\ntransformed before your sight into the giver of your peace. Your “enemy”\nwas God Himself, to Whom all conflict, triumph, and attack of any kind\nare all unknown. He loves you perfectly, completely, and eternally. The\nSon of God at war with his Creator is a condition as ridiculous as\nnature roaring at the wind in anger and proclaiming that it is part of\nitself no more.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> Could nature possibly establish this and make it true? Nor <em>is</em> it up\nto you to say what shall be part of you and what is kept apart. The war\nagainst yourself was undertaken to teach the Son of God that he is not\nhimself and not his Father’s Son. For this, the memory of his Father\n<em>must</em> be forgotten. It <em>is</em> forgotten in the body’s life, and if you\nthink you are a body, you will believe you <em>have</em> forgotten it. Yet\ntruth can never be forgotten by <em>itself</em>, and you have <em>not</em> forgotten\nwhat you are. Only a strange illusion of yourself, a wish to triumph\nover what you are, remembers not.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> The war against yourself is but the battle of two illusions,\nstruggling to make them different from each other in the belief the one\nwhich conquers will be true. There <em>is</em> no conflict between them and the\n<em>truth.</em> Nor <em>are</em> they different from each other. Both are not true.\nAnd so it matters not what form they take. What made them is insane, and\nthey remain part of what made them. Madness holds out no menace to\nreality and has no influence upon it. Illusions <em>cannot</em> triumph over\ntruth, nor can they threaten it in any way. And the reality which they\ndeny is not a part of them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> What <em>you</em> remember <em>is</em> a part of you. For you <em>must</em> be as God\ncreated you. Truth does not fight against illusions, nor do illusions\nfight against the truth. Illusions battle only with themselves. Being\nfragmented, they fragment. But truth is indivisible and far beyond their\nlittle reach. You will remember what you know when you have learned you\ncannot <em>be</em> in conflict. One illusion about yourself can battle with\nanother, yet the war of two illusions is a state where <em>nothing</em>\nhappens. There is no victor, and there is no victory. And truth stands\nradiant, apart from conflict, untouched and quiet in the peace of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> Conflict must be between <em>two</em> forces. It cannot exist between one\npower and nothingness. There is nothing you could attack that is not\npart of you. And <em>by</em> attacking it, you make two illusions of yourself\nin conflict with each other. And this occurs whenever you look on\nanything that God created with anything but love. Conflict is fearful,\nfor it is the <em>birth</em> of fear. Yet what is born of nothing cannot win\nreality through battle. Why would you fill your world with conflicts\nwith yourself? Let all this madness be undone for you and turn in peace\nto the remembrance of God, still shining in your quiet mind.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> See how the conflict of illusions disappears when it is brought to\ntruth! For it seems real only as long as it is seen as war between\nconflicting <em>truths</em>, the conqueror to be the truer, the more real, and\nvanquisher of the illusion that was less real, made an illusion by\ndefeat. Thus, conflict is the choice <em>between</em> illusions, one to be\ncrowned as real, the other vanquished and despised. Here will the Father\n<em>never</em> be remembered. Yet no illusion can invade His home and drive Him\nout of what He loves forever. And what He loves must be forever quiet\nand at peace <em>because</em> it is His home. And you who are beloved of Him\nare no illusions, being as true and holy as Himself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> The stillness of your certainty of Him and of yourself is home to\nboth of you, who dwell as one and not apart. Open the door of His most\nholy home and let forgiveness sweep away all trace of the belief in sin\nthat keeps God homeless and His Son with Him. You are not strangers in\nthe house of God. Welcome your brother to the home where God has set him\nin serenity and peace and dwells with him. Illusions have no place where\nlove abides, protecting you from everything that is not true. You dwell\nin peace as limitless as its Creator, and everything is given those who\nwould remember Him. Over His home the Holy Spirit watches, sure that its\npeace can never be disturbed.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> How can the resting-place of God turn on itself and seek to overcome\nthe One Who dwells there? And think what happens when the house of God\nperceives itself divided. The altar disappears, the light grows dim, the\ntemple of the Holy One becomes a house of sin. And nothing is remembered\nexcept illusions. Illusions can conflict because their forms are\ndifferent. And they do battle only to establish which form is true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> Illusion meets illusion; truth, itself. The meeting of illusions\nleads to war. Peace, looking on itself, extends itself. War is the\ncondition in which fear is born and grows and seeks to dominate. Peace\nis the state where love abides and seeks to share itself. Conflict and\npeace are opposites. Where one abides the other cannot be; where either\ngoes the other disappears. So is the memory of God obscured in minds\nthat have become illusion’s battleground. Yet far beyond this senseless\nwar it shines, ready to be remembered when you side with peace.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>19</sup> The “laws” of chaos can be brought to light, though never understood.\nChaotic laws are hardly meaningful and therefore out of reason’s sphere.\nYet they appear to constitute an obstacle to reason and to truth. Let\nus, then, look upon them calmly, that we may look beyond them,\nunderstanding what they are, not what they would maintain. It is\nessential it be understood what they are for, because it is their\npurpose to make meaningless and to attack the truth. Here are the laws\nthat rule the world you made. And yet they govern nothing and need not\nbe broken; merely looked upon and gone beyond.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> The first chaotic law is that the truth is different for everyone.\nLike all these principles, this one maintains that each is separate and\nhas a different set of thoughts which sets him off from others. This\nprinciple evolves from the belief there is a hierarchy of illusions;\nsome are more valuable and therefore true. Each one establishes this for\nhimself and <em>makes</em> it true by his attack on what another values. And\nthis is justified because the values differ and those who hold them seem\nto be unlike and therefore enemies.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> Think how this seems to interfere with the first principle of\nmiracles. For this establishes degrees of truth among illusions, making\nit appear that some of them are harder to overcome than others. If it\nwere realized that they are all the same and equally untrue, it would be\neasy, then, to understand that miracles apply to <em>all</em> of them. Errors\nof any kind can be corrected <em>because</em> they are untrue. When brought to\ntruth instead of to <em>each other</em>, they merely disappear. No part of\nnothing can be more resistant to the truth than can another.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> The second law of chaos, dear indeed to every worshiper of sin, is\nthat each one must sin and therefore deserves attack and death. This\nprinciple, closely related to the first, is the demand that errors call\nfor punishment and not correction. For the destruction of the one who\nmakes the error places him beyond correction and beyond forgiveness.\nWhat he has done is thus interpreted as an irrevocable sentence upon\nhimself, which God Himself is powerless to overcome. Sin cannot be\nremitted, being the belief the Son of God can make mistakes for which\nhis own destruction becomes inevitable.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> Think what this seems to do to the relationship between the Father\nand the Son. Now it appears that they can never be one again. For <em>one</em>\nmust always be condemned and by the <em>other.</em> Now are they different and\n<em>enemies.</em> And their relationship is one of opposition, just as the\nseparate aspects of the Son meet only to conflict but not to join. One\nbecomes weak, the other strong by his defeat. And fear of God and of\neach other now appears as sensible, made real by what the Son of God has\ndone both to himself and his Creator. The arrogance on which the laws of\nchaos stand could not be more apparent than emerges here.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> Here is a principle which would define what the Creator of reality\nmust be; what He must think and what He must believe; and how He must\nrespond, believing it. It is not seen as even necessary that He be asked\nabout the truth of what has been established for His belief. His Son can\ntell Him this, and He has but the choice whether to take his word for it\nor be mistaken. This leads directly to the third preposterous belief\nthat seems to make chaos eternal. For if God cannot <em>be</em> mistaken, then\nHe <em>must</em> accept his Son’s belief in what he is and hate him for it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> See how the fear of God is reinforced by this third principle. Now it\nbecomes impossible to turn to Him for help in misery. For now He has\nbecome the “enemy” Who <em>caused</em> it and to Whom appeal is useless. Nor\ncan salvation lie within the Son, whose every aspect seems to be at war\nwith Him and justified in its attack. And now is conflict made\ninevitable and beyond the help of God. And now salvation must remain\nimpossible because the savior has become the enemy.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> There can be no release and no escape. Atonement thus becomes a myth,\nand vengeance, not forgiveness, is the Will of God. From where all this\nbegins, there is no sight of help that can succeed. Only destruction can\n<em>be</em> the outcome. And God Himself seems to be siding with it to overcome\nHis Son. Think not the ego will enable you to find escape from what it\n<em>wants.</em> That is the function of this course, which does not value what\nthe ego cherishes.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> The ego values only what it <em>takes</em>. This leads to the fourth law of\nchaos, which, if the others are accepted, must be true. This seeming law\nis the belief you <em>have</em> what you have taken. By this, another’s loss\nbecomes your gain, and thus it fails to recognize that you can never\ntake away save from <em>yourself</em>. Yet all the other laws must lead to\nthis. For enemies do not give willingly to one another, nor would they\nseek to share the things they value. And what your enemies would keep\nfrom you must be worth having, just because they keep it hidden from\nyour sight.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> All of the mechanisms of madness are seen emerging here: the “enemy,”\nmade strong by keeping hidden the valuable inheritance which should be\nyours; your justified position and attack for what has been withheld;\nand the inevitable loss the enemy must suffer to save yourself. Thus do\nthe guilty ones protest their “innocence.” Were they not forced into\nthis foul attack by the unscrupulous behavior of the enemy, they would\nrespond with only kindness. But in a savage world, the kind cannot\nsurvive, so they must take or else be taken from.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> And now there is a vague unanswered question, not yet “explained.”\nWhat is this precious thing, this priceless pearl, this hidden secret\ntreasure, to be wrested in righteous wrath from this most treacherous\nand cunning enemy? It must be what you want but never found. And now you\n“understand” the reason why you found it not. For it was taken from you\nby this enemy and hidden where you would not think to look. He hid it in\nhis body, making it the cover for his guilt, the hiding place for what\nbelongs to you. Now must his body be destroyed and sacrificed that you\nmay <em>have</em> that which belongs to you. His treachery demands his death\nthat <em>you</em> may live. And you attack only in self defense.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> But what is it you want that <em>needs</em> his death? Can you be sure your\nmurderous attack is justified unless you know what it is <em>for</em>? And here\na final principle of chaos comes to the rescue. It holds there is a\n<em>substitute</em> for love. This is the “magic” that will cure all of your\npain; the missing factor in your madness that makes it “sane.” This is\nthe reason why you must attack. Here is what makes your vengeance\njustified. Behold, unveiled, the ego’s secret gift, torn from your\nbrother’s body, hidden there in malice and in hatred for the one to whom\nthe gift belongs. He would deprive you of the secret ingredient which\nwould give meaning to your life. The substitute for love, born of your\nenmity to one another, must be salvation. It has no substitute, and\nthere is only one. And all your relationships have but the purpose of\nseizing it and making it your own.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> Never is your possession made complete. And never will your brother\ncease his attack on you for what you stole. Nor will God end His\nvengeance upon both, for in His madness He must have this substitute for\nlove and kill you both. You who believe you walk in sanity, with feet on\nsolid ground and through a world where meaning can be found, consider\nthis: [These <em>are</em> the laws on which your “sanity” appears to rest.]\nThese <em>are</em> the principles which make the ground beneath your feet seem\nsolid. And it <em>is</em> here you look for meaning. These are the laws you\nmade for your salvation. They hold in place the substitute for Heaven\nwhich you prefer. This is their purpose; they were made for this. There\nis no point in asking what they mean. That is apparent. The means of\nmadness must be insane. Are you as certain that you realize the <em>goal</em>\nis madness?</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> No one <em>wants</em> madness, nor does anyone cling to his madness if he\nsees that this is what it <em>is</em>. What protects madness is the belief that\nit is <em>true</em>. It is the function of insanity to take the <em>place</em> of\ntruth. It must be seen as truth to be believed. And if it is the truth,\nthen must its opposite, which was the truth before, be madness now. Such\na reversal, completely turned around, with madness sanity, illusions\ntrue, attack a kindness, hatred love and murder benediction, is the goal\nthe laws of chaos serve. These are the means by which the laws of God\nappear to be reversed. Here do the laws of sin appear to hold love\ncaptive and let sin go free.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> These do not <em>seem</em> to be the goals of chaos, for by the great\nreversal, they appear to be the laws of <em>order</em>. How could it not be so?\nChaos is lawlessness and <em>has</em> no laws. To be believed, its seeming laws\nmust be perceived as real. Their goal of madness must be seen as sanity.\nAnd fear, with ashen lips and sightless eyes, blinded and terrible to\nlook upon, is lifted to the throne of love, its dying conqueror, its\nsubstitute, the savior from salvation. How lovely do the laws of fear\nmake death appear! Give thanks unto the hero on love’s throne, who saved\nthe Son of God for fear and death!</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> And yet, how can it be that laws like these can be believed? There is\na strange device that makes it possible. Nor is it unfamiliar; we have\nseen how it appears to function many times before. In truth it does\n<em>not</em> function, yet in dreams, where only shadows play the major roles,\nit seems most powerful. No law of chaos could compel belief but for the\nemphasis on <em>form</em> and disregard of <em>content</em>. No one who thinks that\none of them is true <em>sees</em> what it says. Some forms it takes seem to\nhave meaning, and that is all.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> How can some forms of murder <em>not</em> mean death? Can an attack in <em>any</em>\nform be love? What <em>form</em> of condemnation is a blessing? Who makes his\nsavior powerless and <em>finds</em> salvation? Let not the form of the attack\non him deceive you. You <em>cannot</em> seek to harm him and be saved. Who can\nfind safety from attack by turning on himself? How can it matter <em>what</em>\nthe form this madness takes? It is a judgment that defeats itself,\ncondemning what it says it wants to save. Be not deceived when madness\ntakes a form you think is lovely. What is intent on your destruction is\n<em>not</em> your friend.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> You would maintain and think it true that you do not believe these\nsenseless laws nor act upon them. And when you look at what they <em>say</em>,\nthey cannot <em>be</em> believed. Brothers, you <em>do</em> believe them. For how else\ncould you perceive the form they take with content such as this? Can\n<em>any</em> form of this be tenable? Yet you believe them <em>for</em> the form they\ntake and do not <em>recognize</em> the content. It never changes. Can you paint\nrosy lips upon a skeleton, dress it in loveliness, pet it and pamper it,\nand make it <em>live</em>? And can you be content with an <em>illusion</em> that you\nare living?</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> There <em>is</em> no life outside of Heaven. Where God created life, there\nlife must be. In any state apart from Heaven, life is illusion. At best,\nit seems like life; at worst, like death. Yet both are judgments on what\nis not life, equal in their inaccuracy and lack of meaning. Life not in\nHeaven is impossible, and what is not in Heaven is not anywhere. Outside\nof Heaven, only the conflict of illusions stands; senseless, impossible,\nand beyond all reason, and yet perceived as an eternal barrier to\nHeaven. Illusions <em>are</em> but forms. Their content is <em>never</em> true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> The laws of chaos govern all illusions. Their forms conflict, making\nit seem quite possible to value some above the others. Yet each one\nrests as surely on the belief the laws of chaos are the laws of order as\ndo the others. Each one upholds these laws completely, offering a\ncertain witness that these laws are true. The seeming gentler forms of\nthe attack are no less certain in their witnessing or their results.\nCertain it is illusions will bring fear because of the beliefs that they\nimply, not for their form. And lack of faith in love in <em>any</em> form\nattests to chaos as reality.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> From the belief in sin, the faith in chaos <em>must</em> follow. It is\nbecause it follows that it seems to be a logical conclusion—a valid step\nin ordered thought. The steps to chaos <em>do</em> follow neatly from their\nstarting point. Each is a different form in the progression of truth’s\nreversal, leading still deeper into terror and away from truth. Think\nnot one step is smaller than another nor that return from one is easier.\nThe whole descent from Heaven lies in each one. And where your thinking\nstarts, there must it end.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> Brothers, take not one step in the descent to hell. For having taken\none, you will not recognize the rest for what they are. And they <em>will</em>\nfollow. Attack in any form has placed your foot upon the twisted\nstairway that leads from Heaven. Yet any instant it is possible to have\nall this undone. How can you know whether you chose the stairs to Heaven\nor the way to hell? Quite easily. How do you feel? Is peace in your\nawareness? Are you certain which way you go? And are you sure the goal\nof Heaven <em>can</em> be reached? If not, you walk alone. Ask, then, your\nFriend to join with you and <em>give</em> you certainty of where you go.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>41</sup> Is it not true you do not recognize some of the forms attack can\ntake? If it is true attack in any form will hurt you and will do so just\nas much as in another form which you <em>do</em> recognize, then it must follow\nthat you do not always recognize the source of pain. Attack in <em>any</em>\nform is equally destructive. Its purpose does not change. Its sole\nintent is murder, and what form of murder serves to cover the massive\nguilt and frantic fear of punishment the murderer must feel? He may deny\nhe is a murderer and justify his savagery with smiles as he attacks. Yet\nhe will suffer and will look on his intent in nightmares where the\nsmiles are gone and where the purpose rises to meet his horrified\nawareness and pursue him still. For no one thinks of murder and escapes\nthe guilt the <em>thought</em> entails. If the intent is death, what matter the\nform it takes?</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> Is death in any form, however lovely and charitable it may seem to\nbe, a blessing and a sign the Voice for God speaks through you to your\nbrother? The wrapping does not make the gift you give. An empty box,\nhowever beautiful and gently given, still contains nothing. And neither\nthe receiver nor the giver is long deceived. Withhold forgiveness from\nyour brother, and you attack him. You give him nothing and receive of\nhim but what you gave.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> Salvation is no compromise of any kind. To compromise is to accept\nbut part of what you want—to take a little and give up the rest.\nSalvation gives up nothing. It is complete for everyone. Let the idea of\ncompromise but enter, and the awareness of salvation’s purpose is lost\nbecause it is not recognized. It is denied where compromise has been\naccepted, for compromise is the belief salvation is impossible. It would\nmaintain you can attack a little, love a little, and know the\n<em>difference.</em> Thus it would teach a little of the same can still be\ndifferent, and yet the same remain intact as one. Does this make sense?\nCan it <em>be</em> understood?</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> This course is easy just because it makes no compromise. Yet it seems\ndifficult to those who still believe that compromise is possible. They\ndo not see that, if it is, salvation is <em>attack</em>. Yet it is certain the\nbelief that salvation is impossible cannot uphold a quiet, calm\nassurance it has come. Forgiveness cannot be withheld a little. Nor is\nit possible to attack for this and love for that and understand\nforgiveness. Would you not <em>want</em> to recognize assault upon your peace\nin any form, if only thus does it become impossible that <em>you</em> lose\nsight of it? It can be kept shining before your vision, forever clear\nand never out of sight if you defend it not.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> Those who believe that peace can <em>be</em> defended and that attack is\njustified on its behalf cannot perceive it lies within them. How could\nthey know? Could they accept forgiveness side by side with the belief\nthat murder takes some forms by which their peace is saved? Would they\nbe willing to accept the fact their savage purpose is directed against\nthemselves? No one unites with enemies nor is at one with them in\npurpose. And no one compromises with an enemy but hates him still for\nwhat he kept from him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> Mistake not truce for peace, nor compromise for the escape from\nconflict. To be released from conflict means that it is <em>over</em>. The door\nis open; you have <em>left</em> the battleground. You have not lingered there\nin cowering hope because the guns are stilled an instant and the fear\nthat haunts the place of death is not apparent, that it will not return.\nThere <em>is</em> no safety in a battleground. You can look down on it in\nsafety from above and not be touched. But from within it, you can find\n<em>no</em> safety. Not one tree left standing still will shelter you. Not one\nillusion of protection stands against the faith in murder. Here stands\nthe body, torn between the natural desire to communicate and the\nunnatural intent to murder and to die. Think you the <em>form</em> that murder\ntakes can offer safety? Can guilt be <em>absent</em> from a battlefield? [Do\nnot remain in conflict, for there <em>is</em> no war without attack.]</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>47</sup> The fear of God is fear of <em>life</em> and not of death. Yet He remains\nthe only place of safety. In Him is no attack, and no illusion in any\nform stalks Heaven. Heaven is wholly true. No difference enters, and\nwhat is all the same cannot conflict. You are not asked to fight against\nyour wish to murder. But you <em>are</em> asked to realize the form it takes\nconceals the same intent. And it is <em>this</em> you fear and not the form.\nWhat is not love is murder. What is not loving <em>must</em> be an attack.\nEvery illusion is an assault on truth, and every one does violence to\nthe idea of love because it seems to be of <em>equal</em> truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> What can be equal to the truth yet different? Murder and love are\nincompatible. Yet if they both are true, then must they be the same and\nindistinguishable from one another. So will they be to those who see\nGod’s Son a body. For it is not the body that is like the Son’s Creator.\nAnd what is lifeless cannot <em>be</em> the Son of Life. How can a body be\nextended to hold the universe? Can it create and <em>be</em> what it creates?\nAnd can it offer its creations all that it is and never suffer loss?</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> God does not share His function with a body. He gave the function to\ncreate unto His Son because it is His own. It is not sinful to believe\nthe function of the Son is murder, but it <em>is</em> insanity. What is the\nsame can <em>have</em> no different function. Creation is the means for God’s\nextension, and what is His must be His Son’s as well. Either the Father\n<em>and</em> the Son are murderers or neither is. Life makes not death,\ncreating like itself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> The lovely light of your relationship is like the love of God. It\ncannot yet assume the holy function God gave His Son, for your\nforgiveness of one another is not complete as yet, and so it cannot be\nextended to all creation. Each form of murder and attack that still\nattracts you and that you do not recognize for what it is limits the\nhealing and the miracles you have the power to extend to all. Yet does\nthe Holy Spirit understand how to increase your little gifts and make\nthem mighty. Also He understands how your relationship is raised above\nthe battleground, in it no more. This is your part—to realize that\nmurder in <em>any</em> form is not your will. The <em>overlooking</em> of the\nbattleground is now your purpose.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> Be lifted up and from a higher place look down upon it. From there\nwill your perspective be quite different. Here in the midst of it, it\n<em>does</em> seem real. Here you have <em>chosen</em> to be part of it. Here murder\n<em>is</em> your choice. Yet from above, the choice is miracles instead of\nmurder. And the perspective coming from this choice shows you the battle\nis not real and easily escaped. Bodies may battle, but the clash of\nforms is meaningless. And it is over when you realize it never was\nbegun. How can a battle be perceived as nothingness when you engage in\nit? How can the truth of miracles be recognized if murder is your\nchoice?</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> When the temptation to attack rises to make your mind darkened and\nmurderous, remember you <em>can</em> see the battle from above. Even in forms\nyou do not recognize, the signs you know. There is a stab of pain, a\ntwinge of guilt, and above all, a loss of peace. This you know well.\nWhen it occurs, leave not your place on high but quickly choose a\nmiracle <em>instead</em> of murder. And God Himself and all the lights of\nHeaven will gently lean to you and hold you up. For you have chosen to\nremain where He would have you, and <em>no</em> illusion can attack the peace\nof God together with His Son.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> See no one from the battleground, for there you look on him from\nnowhere. You have no reference-point from where to look, where meaning\ncan be given what you see. For only bodies could attack and murder, and\nif this is your purpose, then you must be one with them. Only a purpose\nunifies, and those who share a purpose have a mind as one. The body\n<em>has</em> no purpose and must be solitary. From below, it cannot be\nsurmounted. From above, the limits it exerts on those in battle still\nare gone and not perceived. The body stands between the Father and the\nHeaven He created for His Son <em>because</em> it has no purpose.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> Think what is given those who share their Father’s purpose and who\nknow that it is theirs! They want for nothing. Sorrow of any kind is\ninconceivable. Only the light they love is in awareness, and only love\nshines upon them forever. It is their past, their present, and their\nfuture always the same, eternally complete, and wholly shared. They know\nit is impossible their happiness could ever suffer change of any kind.\nPerhaps you think the battleground can offer something that you can win.\nCan it be anything that offers you a perfect calmness and a sense of\nlove so deep and quiet that no touch of doubt can ever mar your\ncertainty? And that will last forever?</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> Those with the strength of God in their awareness could never think\nof battle. What could they gain but <em>loss</em> of their perfection? For\neverything fought for on the battleground is of the body—something it\nseems to offer or to own. No one who knows that he has everything could\nseek for limitation, nor could he value the body’s offerings. The\nsenselessness of conquest is quite apparent from the quiet sphere above\nthe battleground. What can conflict with everything? And what is there\nthat offers less, yet could be wanted more? Who with the love of God\nupholding him could find the choice of miracles or murder hard to make?</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>3</sup> Love is extension. To withhold the smallest gift is not to know love’s\npurpose. Love offers everything forever. Hold back but one belief, one\noffering, and love is gone because you asked a substitute to take its\nplace. And now must war, the substitute for peace, come with the one\nalternative that you can choose for love. Your choosing it has given it\nall the reality it seems to have.</p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup> Beliefs will never openly attack each other, because conflicting\noutcomes are impossible. But an unrecognized belief is a decision to war\nin secret, where the results of conflict are kept unknown and never\nbrought to reason to be considered sensible or not. And many senseless\noutcomes have been reached, and meaningless decisions have been made and\nkept hidden to become beliefs, now given power to direct all subsequent\ndecisions. Mistake you not the power of these hidden warriors to disrupt\nyour peace. For it <em>is</em> at their mercy while you decide to leave it\nthere. The secret enemies of peace, your least decision to choose attack\ninstead of love, unrecognized and swift to challenge you to combat and\nto violence far more inclusive than you think, are there by your\nelection. Do not deny their presence nor their terrible results. All\nthat can be denied is their <em>reality</em>, but not their outcome.</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> All that is ever cherished as a hidden belief, to be defended though\nunrecognized, is faith in specialness. This takes many forms but always\nclashes with the reality of God’s creation and with the grandeur which\nHe gave His Son. What else could justify attack? For who could hate\nsomeone whose Self is his and whom He knows? Only the special could have\nenemies, for they are different and not the same. And difference of any\nkind imposes orders of reality and a need to judge that cannot be\nescaped.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> What God created cannot be attacked, for there is nothing in the\nuniverse unlike itself. But what is different <em>calls</em> for judgment, and\nthis must come from someone “better,” someone incapable of being like\nwhat he condemns, “above” it, sinless by comparison with it. And thus\ndoes specialness become a means and end at once. For specialness not\nonly sets apart but serves as grounds from which attack on those who\nseem “beneath” the special one is “natural” and “just.” The special ones\nfeel weak and frail <em>because</em> of differences, for what would make them\nspecial <em>is</em> their enemy. Yet they protect its enmity and call it\n“friend.” On its behalf they fight against the universe, for nothing in\nthe world they value more.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> Specialness is the great dictator of the wrong decisions. Here is the\ngrand illusion of what you are and what your brother is. And here is\nwhat must make the body dear and worth preserving. Specialness must be\n<em>defended</em>. Illusions <em>can</em> attack it, and they <em>do</em>. For what your\nbrother must become to <em>keep</em> your specialness <em>is</em> an illusion. He who\nis “worse” than you must be attacked so that your specialness can live\non his defeat. For specialness is triumph, and its victory is his defeat\nand shame. How can he live with all your sins upon him? And who must be\nhis conqueror but you?</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> Would it be possible for you to hate your brother if you were like\nhim? Could you attack him if you realized you journey with him to a goal\nthat is the same? Would you not help him reach it in every way you could\nif his attainment of it were perceived as yours? You <em>are</em> his enemy in\nspecialness; his friend in a shared purpose. Specialness can never\nshare, for it depends on goals that you alone can reach. And he must\nnever reach them, or your goal is jeopardized. Can love have meaning\nwhere the goal is triumph? And what decision can be made for this that\nwill not hurt you? Your brother is your friend <em>because</em> his Father\ncreated him like you. There <em>is</em> no difference. You have been given to\neach other that love might be extended, not cut off from one another.\nWhat you <em>keep</em> is lost to you. God gave you both Himself, and to\nremember this is now the only purpose that you share. And so it is the\nonly one you <em>have</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> Could you attack each other if you chose to see no specialness of any\nkind between you? Look fairly at whatever makes you give each other only\npartial welcome or would let you think that you are better off apart. Is\nit not always your belief your specialness is <em>limited</em> by your\nrelationship? And is not this the “enemy” that makes you both illusions\nto each other?</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> The fear of God and of each other comes from each unrecognized belief\nin specialness. For each demands the other bow to it <em>against</em> his will.\nAnd God Himself must honor it or suffer vengeance. Every twinge of\nmalice or stab of hate or wish to separate arises here. For here the\npurpose which you share becomes obscured from both of you. You would\noppose this course because it teaches you you are <em>alike</em>. You have no\npurpose that is not the same and none your Father does not share with\nyou. For your relationship has been made clean of special goals. And\nwould you now <em>defeat</em> the goal of holiness that Heaven gave it? What\nperspective can the special have that does not change with every seeming\nblow, each slight, or fancied judgment on itself?</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> Those who are special <em>must</em> defend illusions against the truth. For\nwhat is specialness but an attack upon the Will of God? You love your\nbrother not while it is this you would defend against him. This is what\n<em>he</em> attacks and <em>you</em> protect. Here is the ground of battle which you\nwage against him. Here must he be your enemy and not your friend. Never\ncan there be peace among the different. He is your friend <em>because</em> you\nare the same.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>12</sup> Comparison must be an ego device, for love makes none. Specialness\n<em>always</em> makes comparisons. It is established by a lack seen in another\nand maintained by searching for and keeping clear in sight all lacks it\ncan perceive. This does it seek, and this it looks upon. And always whom\nit thus diminishes would be your savior, had you not chosen to make of\nhim a tiny measure of your specialness instead. Against the littleness\nyou see in him, you stand as tall and stately, clean and honest, pure\nand unsullied by comparison with what you see. Nor do you understand it\nis <em>yourself</em> that you diminish thus.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> Pursuit of specialness is always at the cost of peace. Who can attack\nhis savior and cut him down yet <em>recognize</em> his strong support? Who can\ndetract from his omnipotence yet <em>share</em> his power? And who can use him\nas the gauge of littleness and be <em>released</em> from limits? You have a\nfunction in salvation. Its pursuit will bring you joy. But the pursuit\nof specialness <em>must</em> bring you pain. Here is a goal that would defeat\nsalvation and thus run counter to the Will of God. To value specialness\nis to esteem an alien will to which illusions of yourself are dearer\nthan the truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> Specialness is the idea of sin made real. Sin is impossible even to\nimagine without this base. For sin arose from it out of nothingness; an\nevil flower with no roots at all. Here is the self-made “savior,” the\n“creator” who creates unlike the Father and which made His Son like to\nitself and not like unto Him. His “special” sons are many, <em>never</em> one,\neach one in exile from himself and Him of Whom they are a part. Nor do\nthey love the Oneness Which created them as one with Him. They chose\ntheir specialness instead of Heaven and instead of peace and wrapped it\ncarefully in sin to keep it “safe” from truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> You are <em>not</em> special. If you think you are and would defend your\nspecialness against the truth of what you <em>really</em> are, how can you know\nthe truth? What answer that the Holy Spirit gives can reach you, when it\nis your specialness to which you listen and which asks and answers? Its\ntiny answer, soundless in the melody which pours from God to you\neternally in loving praise of what you are, is all you listen to. And\nthat vast song of honor and of love for what you are seems silent and\nunheard before its “mightiness.” You strain your ears to hear its\nsoundless voice, and yet the Call of God Himself is soundless to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> You can defend your specialness, but never will you hear the Voice\nfor God beside it. They speak a different language and they fall on\ndifferent ears. To every special one a different message, and one with\ndifferent meaning, is the truth. Yet how can truth be different to each\none? The special messages the special hear convince them they are\ndifferent and apart—each in his special sins and “safe” from love, which\ndoes not see his specialness at all. Christ’s vision is their “enemy,”\nfor it sees not what they would look upon, and it would show them that\nthe specialness they think they see <em>is</em> an illusion. What would they\nsee instead?</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> The shining radiance of the Son of God—so like his Father that the\nmemory of Him springs instantly to mind. And with this memory, the Son\nremembers his own creations, as like to him as he is to his Father. And\nall the world he made and all his specialness and all the sins he held\nin its defense against himself will vanish as his mind accepts the truth\nabout himself as it returns to take their place. This is the only “cost”\nof truth: you will no longer see what never was, nor hear what makes no\nsound. Is it a sacrifice to give up nothing and to receive the love of\nGod forever?</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> You who have chained your savior to your specialness and given it his\nplace, remember this: He has not lost the power to forgive you all the\nsins you think you placed between him and the function of salvation\ngiven him for you. Nor will you change his function, any more than you\ncan change the truth in him and in yourself. But be you certain that the\ntruth is just the same in both. It gives no different messages and has\n<em>one</em> meaning. And it is one you <em>both</em> can understand, and one which\nbrings release to <em>both</em> of you. Here stands your brother with the key\nto Heaven in his hand held out to you. Let not the dream of specialness\nremain between you. What is one is joined in truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> Think of the loveliness that you will see within yourself when you\nhave looked on him as on a friend. He <em>is</em> the enemy of specialness but\nonly friend to what is real in you. Not one attack you thought you made\non him has taken from him the gift that God would have him give to you.\nHis need to give it is as great as yours to have it. Let him forgive you\nall your specialness and make you whole in mind and one with him. He\nwaits for your forgiveness only that he may return it unto you. It is\nnot God Who has condemned His Son. But only you, to save his specialness\nand kill his Self.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> You have come far along the way of truth—too far to falter now. Just\none step more and every vestige of the fear of God will melt away in\nlove. Your brother’s specialness and yours <em>are</em> enemies and bound in\nhate to kill each other and deny they are the same. Yet it is not\nillusions which have reached this final obstacle that seems to make God\nand His Heaven so remote that they cannot be reached. Here in this holy\nplace does truth stand waiting to receive you both in silent blessing\nand in peace so real and so encompassing that nothing stands outside.\nLeave all illusions of yourself outside this place to which you come in\nhope and honesty.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> Here is your savior <em>from</em> your specialness. He is in need of your\nacceptance of himself as part of you, as you for his. You are alike to\nGod as God is to Himself. He is not special, for He would not keep one\npart of what He is unto Himself, not given to His Son but kept for Him\nalone. And it is this you fear, for if He is not special, then He willed\nHis Son be like Him, and your brother <em>is</em> like you. Not special, but\npossessed of everything <em>including</em> you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> Give him but what he has, remembering God gave Himself to both of you\nin equal love that both might share the universe with Him Who chose that\nlove could never be divided and kept separate from what it is and must\nforever be. You <em>are</em> your brother’s; part of love was not denied to\nhim. But can it be that <em>you</em> have lost because <em>he</em> is complete? What\nhas been given him makes <em>you</em> complete, as it does him. God’s love gave\nyou to him and him to you because He gave Himself. What is the same as\nGod is one with Him. And only specialness could make the truth of God\nand you <em>as</em> one seem anything but Heaven and the hope of peace at last\nin sight.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> Specialness is the seal of treachery upon the gift of love. Whatever\nserves its purpose must be given to kill. No gift that bears its seal\nbut offers treachery to giver <em>and</em> receiver. Not one glance from eyes\nit veils but looks on sight of death. Not one believer in its potency\nbut seeks for bargains and for compromise that would establish sin\nlove’s substitute and serve it faithfully. And no relationship that\nholds its purpose dear but clings to murder as safety’s weapon and the\ngreat defender of all illusions from the “threat” of love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> The hope of specialness makes it seem possible God made the body as\nthe prison-house which keeps His Son from Him. For it demands a special\nplace God cannot enter and a hiding-place where none is welcome but your\ntiny self. Nothing is sacred here but unto you and you alone, apart and\nseparate from all your brothers, safe from all intrusions of sanity upon\nillusions, safe from God, and safe for conflict everlasting. Here are\nthe gates of hell you closed upon yourself, to rule in madness and in\nloneliness your special kingdom, apart from God, away from truth and\nfrom salvation.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> The key you threw away God gave your brother, whose holy hands would\noffer it to you when you were ready to accept His plan for your\nsalvation in place of yours. How could this readiness be reached save\nthrough the sight of all your misery and the awareness that your plan\nhas failed and will forever fail to bring you peace and joy of any kind?\nThrough this despair you travel now, yet it is but <em>illusion</em> of\ndespair. The death of specialness is not <em>your</em> death but your awaking\ninto life eternal. You but emerge from an illusion of what you are to\nthe acceptance of yourself as God created you.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>26</sup> Forgiveness is the end of specialness. Only illusions can be\nforgiven, and then they disappear. Forgiveness is release from <em>all</em>\nillusions, and that is why it is impossible but partly to forgive. No\none who clings to one illusion can see himself as sinless, for he holds\none error to himself as lovely still. And so he calls it “unforgivable”\nand makes it sin. How can he then <em>give</em> his forgiveness wholly, when he\nwould not receive it for himself? For it is sure he would receive it\nwholly the instant that he gave it so. And thus his secret guilt would\ndisappear, forgiven by himself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> Whatever form of specialness you cherish, you have made sin.\nInviolate it stands, strongly defended with all your puny might against\nthe Will of God. And thus it stands against yourself; <em>your</em> enemy, not\nGod’s. So does it seem to split you off from God and make you separate\nfrom Him as its defender. You would protect what God created not. And\nyet this idol that seems to <em>give</em> you power has taken it away. For you\nhave given your brother’s birthright to it, leaving him alone and\nunforgiven and yourself in sin beside him, both in misery before the\nidol that can save you not.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> It is not <em>you</em> that is so vulnerable and open to attack that just a\nword, a little whisper that you do not like, a circumstance that suits\nyou not, or an event that you did not anticipate upsets your world and\nhurls it into chaos. Truth is not frail. Illusions leave it perfectly\nunmoved [and undisturbed]. But specialness is <em>not</em> the truth in you.\n<em>It</em> can be thrown off balance by anything. What rests on nothing\n<em>never</em> can be stable. However large and overblown it seems to be, it\nstill must rock and turn and whirl about with every breeze.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> Without foundation nothing is secure. Would God have left His Son in\nsuch a state, where safety has no meaning? No, His Son is safe, resting\non Him. It is your specialness that is attacked by everything that walks\nand breathes or creeps or crawls or even lives at all. Nothing is safe\nfrom its attack, and it is safe from nothing. It will forever more be\nunforgiving, for that is what it <em>is</em>—a secret vow that what God wants\nfor you will never be and that you will oppose His Will forever. Nor is\nit possible the two can ever be the same while specialness stands like a\nflaming sword of death between them and makes them “enemies.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> God asks for your forgiveness. He would have no separation, like an\nalien will, rise between what He wills for you and what you will. They\n<em>are</em> the same, for neither one wills specialness. How could they will\nthe death of love itself? Yet they are powerless to make attack upon\nillusions. They are not bodies; as One mind they wait for all illusions\nto be brought to them and left behind. Salvation challenges not even\ndeath. And God Himself, Who knows that death is not your will, must say,\n“Thy will be done” because <em>you</em> think it <em>is</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> Forgive the great Creator of the universe, the Source of life, of\nlove and holiness, the perfect Father of a perfect Son, for your\nillusions of your specialness. Here is the hell you chose to be your\nhome. He chose not this for you. Ask not He enter this. The way is\nbarred to love and to salvation. Yet if you would release your brother\nfrom the depths of hell, you have forgiven Him Whose Will it is you rest\nforever in the arms of peace in perfect safety and without the heat and\nmalice of one thought of specialness to mar your rest. Forgive the Holy\nOne the specialness He could not give and which you made instead.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> The special ones are all asleep, surrounded by a world of loveliness\nthey do not see. Freedom and peace and joy stand there beside the bier\non which they sleep and call them to come forth and waken from their\ndream of death. Yet they hear nothing. They are lost in dreams of\nspecialness. They hate the call that would awaken them, and they curse\nGod because He did not make their dream reality. Curse God and die, but\nnot by Him Who made not death, but only in the dream. Open your eyes a\nlittle; see the savior God gave to you that you might look on him and\ngive him back his birthright. It is <em>yours.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> The slaves of specialness will yet be free. Such is the Will of God\nand of His Son. Would God condemn <em>Himself</em> to hell and to damnation?\nAnd do <em>you</em> will that this be done unto your savior? God calls to you\nfrom him to join His Will to save you <em>both</em> from hell.

    "content": "<p><sup>34</sup> Specialness is a lack of trust in anyone except yourself. Faith is\ninvested in yourself alone. Everything else becomes your enemy—feared\nand attacked, deadly and dangerous, hated and worthy only of\ndestruction. Whatever gentleness it offers is but deception, but its\nhate is real. In danger of destruction, it must kill, and you are drawn\nto it to kill it first. And such is guilt’s attraction. Here is death\nenthroned as savior; crucifixion is now redemption, and salvation can\nonly mean destruction of the world, except yourself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> What could the purpose of the body <em>be</em> but specialness? And it is\nthis that makes it frail and helpless in its own defense. It was\nconceived to make <em>you</em> frail and helpless. The goal of separation is\nits curse. Yet bodies <em>have</em> no goal. Purpose is of the <em>mind</em>. And\nminds can change as they desire. What they are and all their attributes,\nthey <em>cannot</em> change. But what they hold as purpose <em>can</em> be changed,\nand body states must shift accordingly. Of itself the body can do\nnothing. See it as means to hurt, and it is hurt. See it as means to\nheal, and it is healed.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> You can but hurt <em>yourself</em>. This has been oft repeated but is\ndifficult to grasp as yet. To minds intent on specialness, it is\nimpossible. Yet to those who wish to heal and not attack, it is quite\nobvious. The purpose of attack is in the <em>mind</em>, and its effects are\nfelt but where it <em>is</em>. Nor is mind limited; so must it be that harmful\npurpose hurts the mind as one. Nothing could make <em>less</em> sense to\nspecialness. Nothing could make <em>more</em> sense to miracles. For miracles\nare merely change of purpose from hurt to healing.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> This shift in purpose <em>does</em> “endanger” specialness, but only in the\nsense that all illusions are “threatened” by the truth. They will <em>not</em>\nstand before it. Yet what comfort has ever been in them that you would\nkeep the gift your Father asks from Him and give it there instead? Given\nto <em>Him</em>, the universe is yours. Offered to <em>them</em>, no gifts can be\nreturned. What you have given specialness has left you bankrupt and your\ntreasure house barren and empty with an open door inviting everything\nthat would disturb your peace to enter and destroy.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> Long ago we said consider not the means by which salvation is\nattained nor how to reach it. But <em>do</em> consider, and consider well,\nwhether it is your wish that you might see your brother sinless. To\nspecialness the answer must be “no.” A sinless brother <em>is</em> its enemy,\nwhile sin, if it were possible, would be its friend. Your brother’s sins\nwould justify itself and give it meaning that the truth denies. All that\nis real proclaims his sinlessness. All that is false proclaims his sins\nas real. If <em>he</em> is sinful, then is <em>your</em> reality not real but just a\ndream of specialness which lasts an instant, crumbling into dust.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> Do not defend this senseless dream in which God is bereft of what He\nloves and you remain beyond salvation. Only this is certain in this\nshifting world which has no meaning in reality: when peace is not with\nyou entirely and when you suffer pain of any kind, you have beheld some\nsin within your brother and have <em>rejoiced</em> at what you thought was\nthere. Your specialness seemed safe because of it. And thus you saved\nwhat <em>you</em> appointed to be your savior and crucified the one whom God\nhas given you instead. So are you bound with him, for you <em>are</em> one. And\nso is specialness his “enemy” and <em>yours</em> as well.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>40</sup> The Christ in you is very still. He looks on what He loves and knows\nit as Himself. And thus does He rejoice at what He sees because He knows\nthat it is one with Him and with His Father. Specialness, too, takes joy\nin what it sees, although it is not true. Yet what you seek for <em>is</em> a\nsource of joy as you conceive it. What you wish is true for you. Nor is\nit possible that you can wish for something and lack faith that it is\nso. Wishing <em>makes</em> real, as surely as does will create. The power of a\nwish upholds illusions as strongly as does love extend itself, except\nthat one deludes; the other heals.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> There is no dream of specialness—however hidden or disguised the\nform; however lovely it may seem to be; however much it delicately\noffers the hope of peace and the escape from pain—in which you suffer\nnot your condemnation. In dreams, effect and cause are interchanged, for\nhere the maker of the dream believes that what he made is happening to\nhim. He does not realize he picked a thread from here, a scrap from\nthere, and wove a picture out of nothing. For the parts do not belong\ntogether, and the whole contributes nothing to the parts to give them\nmeaning.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> Where could your peace arise <em>but</em> from forgiveness? The Christ in\nyou looks only on the truth and sees no condemnation that could <em>need</em>\nforgiveness. He is at peace <em>because</em> He sees no sin. Identify with Him,\nand what has He that you have not? He is your eyes, your ears, your\nhands, your feet. How gentle are the sights He sees, the sounds He\nhears. How beautiful His hand that holds His brother’s, and how lovingly\nHe walks beside him, showing him what can be seen and heard and where he\nwill see nothing and there is no sound to hear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> Yet let your specialness direct his way, and <em>you</em> will follow. And\n<em>both</em> will walk in danger, each intent, in the dark forest of the\nsightless, unlit but by the shifting tiny gleams that spark an instant\nfrom the fireflies of sin and then go out, to lead the other to a\nnameless precipice and hurl him over it. For what can specialness\ndelight in but to kill? What does it seek for but the sight of death?\nWhere does it lead but to destruction? Yet think not that it looked upon\nyour brother first, nor hated him before it hated you. The sin its eyes\nbehold in him and love to look upon, it saw in <em>you</em> and looks on still\nwith joy. Yet <em>is</em> it joy to look upon decay and madness and believe\nthis crumbling thing, with flesh already loosened from the bone and\nsightless holes for eyes, is like yourself?</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> Rejoice you <em>have</em> no eyes with which to see, no ears to listen, and\nno hands to hold nor feet to guide. Be glad that only Christ can lend\nyou His while you have need of them. They are illusions too, as much as\nyours. And yet, because they serve a different purpose, the strength\ntheir purpose holds is given them. And what they see and hear and hold\nand lead is given light that you may lead as you were led.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> The Christ in you is very still. He knows where you are going, and He\nleads you there in gentleness and blessing all the way. His love for God\nreplaces all the fear you thought you saw within yourself. His holiness\nshows you Himself in him whose hand you hold and whom you lead to Him.\nAnd what you see is like yourself. For what but Christ is there to see\nand hear and love and follow home? He looked upon you first but\nrecognized that you were not complete. And so He sought for your\ncompletion in each living thing that He beholds and loves. And seeks it\nstill, that each might offer you the love of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> Yet is He quiet, for He knows that love is in you now and safely held\nin you by that same hand that holds your brother’s in your own. Christ’s\nhand holds all His brothers in Himself. He gives them vision for their\nsightless eyes and sings to them of Heaven that their ears may hear no\nmore the sound of battle and of death. He reaches through them, holding\nout His hand that everyone may bless all living things and see their\nholiness. And He rejoices that these sights are yours to look upon with\nHim and share His joy. His perfect lack of specialness He offers you\nthat you may save all living things from death, receiving from each one\nthe gift of life that your forgiveness offers to your Self. The sight of\nChrist is all there is to see. The song of Christ is all there is to\nhear. The hand of Christ is all there is to hold. There <em>is</em> no journey\nbut to walk with Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> You who would be content with specialness and seek salvation in a war\nwith love, consider this: the holy Lord of Heaven has Himself come down\nto you to offer you your own completion. What is His is yours because in\nyour completion is His Own. He Who willed not to be without His Son\ncould never will that you be brotherless. And would He give a brother\nunto you except he be as perfect as yourself and just as like to Him in\nholiness as <em>you</em> must be?</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> There must be doubt before there can be conflict. And every doubt\nmust be about yourself. Christ has no doubt, and from His certainty His\nquiet comes. He will exchange His certainty for all your doubts if you\nagree that He is one with you and that this Oneness is endless,\ntimeless, and within your grasp <em>because</em> your hands are His. He is\nwithin you, yet He walks beside you and before, leading the way that He\nmust go to find Himself complete. His quietness becomes your certainty.\nAnd where is doubt when certainty has come?</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>49</sup> Before your brother’s holiness the world is still and peace descends\non it in gentleness and blessing so complete that not one trace of\nconflict still remains to haunt you in the darkness of the night. He is\nyour savior from the dreams of fear. He is the healing of your sense of\nsacrifice and fear that what you have will scatter with the wind and\nturn to dust. In him is your assurance God is here and with you <em>now</em>.\nWhile he is what he is, you can be sure that God is knowable and <em>will</em>\nbe known to you. For He could never leave His own creation. And the sign\nthat this is so lies in your brother, offered you that all your doubts\nabout yourself may disappear before his holiness. See in him God’s\ncreation. For in him, his Father waits for your acknowledgment that He\ncreated you as part of Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> Without you there would be a lack in God, a Heaven incomplete, a Son\nwithout a Father. There could be no universe and no reality. For what\nGod wills is whole and part of Him because His Will is One. Nothing\nalive that is not part of Him, and nothing <em>is</em> but is alive in Him.\nYour brother’s holiness shows you that God is one with him and you—that\nwhat he has is yours <em>because</em> you are not separate from him nor from\nhis Father.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> Nothing is lost to you in all the universe. Nothing that God created\nhas He failed to lay before you lovingly as yours forever. And no\nthought within His Mind is absent from your own. It is His Will you\nshare His love for you and look upon yourself as lovingly as He\nconceived of you before the world began and as He knows you still. God\nchanges not His Mind about His Son with passing circumstance, which has\nno meaning in eternity where He abides and you with Him. Your brother\n<em>is</em> as He created him. And it is this that saves you from a world that\nHe created not.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> Forget not that the healing of God’s Son is all the world is <em>for</em>.\nThat is the only purpose the Holy Spirit sees in it and thus the only\none it has. Until you see the healing of the Son as all you wish to be\naccomplished by the world, by time, and all appearances, you will not\nknow the Father nor yourself. For you will use the world for what is not\nits purpose and will not escape its laws of violence and death. Yet it\nis given you to be beyond its laws in <em>all</em> respects, in <em>every</em> way,\nand <em>every</em> circumstance, in <em>all</em> temptation to perceive what is not\nthere and <em>all</em> belief God’s Son can suffer pain because he sees himself\nas he is not.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> Look on your brother and behold in him the whole reversal of the laws\nthat seem to rule this world. See in his freedom <em>yours</em>, for such it\nis. Let not his specialness obscure the truth in him, for not one law of\ndeath you bind him to will <em>you</em> escape. And not one sin you see in him\nbut keeps you <em>both</em> in hell. Yet will his perfect sinlessness <em>release</em>\nyou both, for holiness is quite impartial, with one judgment made for\nall it looks upon. And that is made, not of itself, but through the\nVoice that speaks for God in everything that lives and shares His Being.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> It is <em>His</em> sinlessness that eyes which see can look upon. It is\n<em>His</em> loveliness they see in everything. And it is <em>He</em> they look for\neverywhere and find no sight nor place nor time where He is not. Within\nyour brother’s holiness, the perfect frame for your salvation and the\nworld’s, is set the shining memory of Him in Whom your brother lives and\nyou along with him. Let not your eyes be blinded by the veil of\nspecialness that hides the face of Christ from him, and you as well. And\nlet the fear of God no longer hold the vision you were meant to see from\nyou. Your brother’s body shows not Christ to you. He <em>is</em> set forth\nwithin his holiness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> Choose, then, his body or his holiness as what you <em>want</em> to see, and\nwhich you choose is yours to look upon. Yet will you choose in countless\nsituations and through time which seems to have no end until the truth\nbe your decision. For eternity is not regained by still one more denial\nof Christ in him. And where is your salvation if he is but a body? Where\nis your peace but in his holiness? And where is God Himself but in that\npart of Him He set forever in your brother’s holiness that you might see\nthe truth about yourself set forth at last in terms you recognized and\nunderstood?</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Your brother’s holiness is sacrament and benediction unto you. His\nerrors cannot withhold God’s blessing from himself nor you who see him\ntruly. His mistakes can cause delay, which it is given you to take from\nhim that both may end a journey that has never been begun and needs no\nend. What never was is not a part of you. Yet you will <em>think</em> it is\nuntil you realize that it is not a part of him who stands beside you. He\nis the mirror of yourself wherein you see the judgment you have laid on\nboth of you. The Christ in you beholds his holiness. Your specialness\nlooks on his body and beholds him not.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> See him as what he <em>is</em> that your deliverance may not be long. A\nsenseless wandering, without a purpose and without accomplishment of any\nkind, is all the other choice can offer you. Futility of function not\nfulfilled will haunt you while your brother lies asleep, till what has\nbeen assigned to you is done and he is risen from the past. He who\ncondemned himself, and you as well, is given you to save from\ncondemnation along with you. And <em>both</em> shall see God’s glory in His\nSon, whom you mistook as flesh and bound to laws that have no power over\nhim at all.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> Would you not gladly realize these laws are not for you? Then see him\nnot as prisoner to them. It cannot be what governs part of God holds not\nfor all the rest. You place yourself under the laws you see as ruling\nhim. Think, then, how great the love of God for you must be that He has\ngiven you a part of Him to save from pain and give you happiness. And\nnever doubt but that your specialness will disappear before the Will of\nGod, Who loves each part of Him with equal love [and care]. The Christ\nin you <em>can</em> see your brother truly. Would <em>you</em> decide against the\nholiness He sees?</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> Specialness is the function which you gave yourself. It stands for\nyou alone, as self-created, self-maintained, in need of nothing, and\nunjoined with anything beyond the body. In its eyes, you are a separate\nuniverse with all the power to hold itself complete within itself, with\nevery entry shut against intrusion and every window barred against the\nlight. Always attacked and always furious, with anger always fully\njustified, you have pursued this goal with vigilance you never thought\nto yield and effort that you never thought to cease. And all this grim\ndetermination was for this—you wanted specialness to be the <em>truth</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> Now you are merely asked that you pursue another goal with far less\nvigilance—with little effort and with little time and with the power of\nGod maintaining it and promising success. Yet of the two, it is <em>this</em>\none you find more difficult. The “sacrifice” of self you understand, nor\ndo you deem this cost too heavy. But a tiny willingness, a nod to God, a\ngreeting to the Christ in you, you find a burden wearisome and tedious,\ntoo heavy to be borne. Yet to the dedication to the truth as God\nestablished it no sacrifice is asked, no strain called forth, and all\nthe power of Heaven and the might of truth itself is given to provide\nthe means and <em>guarantee</em> the goal’s accomplishment.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> You who believe it easier to see your brother’s body than his\nholiness, be sure you understand what made this judgment. Here is the\nvoice of specialness heard clearly, judging against the Christ and\nsetting forth for you the purpose that you can attain and what you\ncannot do. Forget not that this judgment must apply to what you do with\n<em>it</em> as your ally. For what you do through Christ it does not know. To\nHim this judgment makes no sense at all, for only what His Father wills\nis possible, and there is no alternative for Him to see. Out of His lack\nof conflict comes your peace. And from His purpose comes the means for\neffortless accomplishment and rest.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>62</sup> How bitterly does everyone tied to this world defend the specialness\nhe wants to be the truth! His wish is law unto him, and he obeys.\nNothing his specialness demands does he withhold. Nothing it needs does\nhe deny to what he loves. And while it calls to him, he hears no other\nVoice. No effort is too great, no cost too much, no price too dear to\nsave his specialness from the least slight, the tiniest attack, the\nwhispered doubt, the hint of threat, or anything but deepest reverence.\nThis is your son, beloved of you as you are to your Father. Yet it\nstands in place of your creations, who <em>are</em> son to you, that you might\n<em>share</em> the Fatherhood of God, not snatch it from Him. What is this son\nthat you have made to be your strength? What is this child of earth on\nwhom such love is lavished? What is this parody of God’s creation that\ntakes the place of yours? And where are <em>they</em>, now that the host of God\nhas found another son which he prefers to them?</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> The memory of God shines not alone. What is within your brother still\ncontains all of creation, everything created and creating, born and\nunborn as yet, still in the future or apparently gone by. What is in him\nis changeless, and your changelessness is recognized in its\nacknowledgment. The holiness in you belongs to him. And by your seeing\nit in him, returns to you. All of the tribute you have given specialness\nbelongs to him and thus returns to you. All of the love and care, the\nstrong protection, the thought by day and night, the deep concern, the\npowerful conviction this is you belong to him. Nothing you gave to\nspecialness but is his due. And nothing due him is not due to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> How can you know your worth while specialness claims you instead? How\ncan you fail to know it is in his holiness? Seek not to make your\nspecialness the truth, for if it were, you would be lost indeed. Be\nthankful, rather, it is given you to see his holiness <em>because</em> it is\nthe truth. And what is true in him must be as true in you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> Ask yourself this: can <em>you</em> protect the mind? The body, yes, a\nlittle—not from time, but temporarily. And much you think you save, you\nhurt. What would you save it <em>for</em>? For in that choice lie both its\nhealth and harm. Save it for show, as bait to catch another fish, to\nhouse your specialness in better style or weave a frame of loveliness\naround your hate, and you condemn it to decay and death. And if you see\nthis purpose in your brother’s, such is your condemnation of your own.\nWeave, rather then, a frame of holiness around him that the truth may\nshine on him and give you safety from decay.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> The Father keeps what He created safe. You cannot touch it with the\nfalse ideas you made because it was created not by you. Let not your\nfoolish fancies frighten you. What is immortal cannot <em>be</em> attacked;\nwhat is but temporal <em>has</em> no effect. Only the purpose that you see in\nit has meaning, and if that is true, its safety rests secure. If not, it\nhas no purpose and is means for nothing. Whatever is perceived as means\nfor truth shares in its holiness and rests in light as safely as itself.\nNor will that light go out when it is gone. Its holy purpose gave it\nimmortality, setting another light in Heaven, where your creations\nrecognize a gift from you, a sign that you have not forgotten them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> The test of everything on earth is simply this: “What is it <em>for</em>?”\nThe answer makes it what it is for you. It has no meaning of itself, yet\nyou can give reality to it according to the purpose which you serve.\nHere you are but means, along with it. God is a Means as well as End. In\nHeaven, means and end are one, and one with Him. This is the state of\ntrue creation, found not within time, but in eternity. To no one here is\nthis describable. Nor is there any way to learn what this condition\nmeans. Not till you go past learning to the Given; not till you make\nagain a holy home for your creations is it understood.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> A co-creator with the Father must have a Son. Yet must this Son have\nbeen created like Himself. A perfect being, all-encompassing and\nall-encompassed, nothing to add and nothing taken from—not born of size\nnor weight nor time nor held to limits or uncertainties of any kind.\nHere do the means and end unite as one, nor does this one have any end\nat all. All this is true, and yet it has no meaning to anyone who still\nretains one unlearned lesson in his memory, one thought with purpose\nstill uncertain, or one wish with a divided aim.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> This course makes no attempt to teach what cannot easily be learned.\nIts scope does not exceed your own, except to say that what is yours\nwill come to you when you are ready. Here are the means and purpose\nseparate because they were so made and so perceived. And therefore do we\ndeal with them as if they were. It is essential it be kept in mind that\nall perception still is upside down until its purpose has been\nunderstood. Perception does not <em>seem</em> to be a means. And it is this\nthat makes it hard to grasp the whole extent to which it must depend on\nwhat you see it <em>for</em>. Perception seems to <em>teach</em> you what you see. Yet\nit but witnesses to what <em>you</em> taught. It is the outward picture of a\nwish—an image that you <em>wanted</em> to be true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> Look at yourself, and you will see a body. Look at this body in a\ndifferent light, and it looks different. And without a light, it seems\nthat it is gone. Yet you are reassured that it is there because you\nstill can feel it with your hands and hear it move. Here is an image\nthat you want to be yourself. It is the means to make your wish come\ntrue. It gives the eyes with which you look on it, the hands that feel\nit, and the ears with which you listened to the sounds it makes. It\n<em>proves</em> its own reality to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> Thus is the body made a theory of yourself with no provisions made\nfor evidence beyond itself and no escape within its sight. Its course is\nsure when seen through its own eyes. It grows and withers, flourishes\nand dies. And you cannot conceive of you apart from it. You brand it\nsinful, and you hate its acts, judging it evil. Yet your specialness\nwhispers, “Here is my own beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.” Thus\ndoes the “son” become the means to serve his “father’s” purpose. Not\nidentical, not even like, but still a means to offer to the “father”\nwhat he <em>wants.</em> Such is the travesty on God’s creation. For as His\nSon’s creation gave Him joy and witness to His love and shared His\npurpose, so does the body testify to the idea that made it and speak for\nits reality and truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> And thus are two sons made, and both appear to walk this earth\nwithout a meeting-place and no encounter. One do you see outside\nyourself, your own beloved son. The other rests within, His Father’s\nSon, within your brother as he is in you. Their difference does not lie\nin how they look, nor where they go, nor even what they do. They have a\ndifferent <em>purpose.</em> It is this that joins them to their like and\nseparates each from all aspects with a different purpose. The Son of God\nretains His Father’s Will. The son of man perceives an alien will and\nwishes it were so. And thus does his perception serve his wish by giving\nit appearances of truth. Yet can perception serve another goal. It is\nnot bound to specialness but by your choice. And it <em>is</em> given you to\nmake a different choice and use perception for a different purpose. And\nwhat you see will serve that purpose well and <em>prove</em> its own reality to\nyou.</p>\n\n",

And in the doing of it will you learn\nthe body merely seems to be the means to do it. For the mind is His. And\nso it must be yours. His holiness directs the body through the mind at\none with Him. And you are manifest unto your holy brother, as he to you.\nHere is the meeting of the holy Christ unto Himself; nor are any\ndifferences perceived to stand between the aspects of His holiness,\nwhich meet and join and raise Him to His Father, whole and pure and\nworthy of His everlasting Love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> How can you manifest the Christ in you except you look on holiness and\nsee Him there? Perception tells you, <em>you</em> are manifest in what you see.\nBehold the body, and you will believe that you are there. And every body\nthat you look upon reminds you of yourself—your sinfulness, your evil,\nand above all, your death. And would you not despise the one who tells\nyou this and seek his death instead? The message and the messenger are\none. And you <em>must</em> see your brother as yourself. Framed in his body,\nyou will see your sinfulness wherein you stand condemned. Set in his\nholiness, the Christ in him proclaims <em>himself</em> as you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> Perception is a choice of what you want yourself to be—the world you\nwant to live in and the state in which you think your mind will be\ncontent and satisfied. It chooses where you think your safety lies, at\nyour decision. It reveals yourself to you as you would have you be. And\nalways is it faithful to your purpose from which it never separates nor\ngives the slightest witness unto anything the purpose in your mind\nupholdeth not. Perception is a part of what it is your purpose to\nbehold, for means and end are never separate. And thus you learn what\nseems to have a life apart has none.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> <em>You</em> are the means for God—not separate nor with a life apart from\nHis. His Life is manifest in you who are His Son. Each aspect of Himself\nis framed in holiness and perfect purity, in love celestial and so\ncomplete it wishes only that it may release all that it looks upon unto\nitself. Its radiance shines through each body that it looks upon and\nbrushes all its darkness into light merely by looking past it <em>to</em> the\nlight. The veil is lifted through its gentleness, and nothing hides the\nface of Christ from its beholders. And both of you stand there, before\nHim now, to let Him draw aside the veil that seems to keep you separate\nand apart.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> Since you <em>believe</em> that you are separate, Heaven presents itself to\nyou as separate too. Not that it is in truth, but that the link that has\nbeen given you to join the truth may reach to you through what you\nunderstand. Father and Son and Holy Spirit are as One, as all your\nbrothers join as one in truth. Christ and His Father never have been\nseparate, and Christ abides within your understanding in the part of you\nthat shares His Father’s Will. The Holy Spirit links the other part, the\ntiny mad desire to be separate, different, and special, to the Christ,\nto make the oneness clear to what is <em>really</em> one. In this world, this\nis not understood but <em>can</em> be taught.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> The Holy Spirit serves Christ’s purpose in your mind, so that the aim\nof specialness can be corrected where the error lies. Because His\npurpose still is one with both the Father and the Son, He knows the Will\nof God and what <em>you</em> really will. But this is understood by mind\nperceived as one, aware that it is one and so <em>experienced</em>. It is the\nHoly Spirit’s function to teach you <em>how</em> this oneness is experienced,\n<em>what</em> you must do that it can be experienced, and <em>where</em> you should go\nto do it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> All this takes note of time and place as if they were discrete, for\nwhile you think that part of you is separate, the concept of a oneness\njoined as one is meaningless. It is apparent that a mind so split could\nnever be the teacher of a Oneness which unites all things within itself.\nAnd so What <em>is</em> within this mind and <em>does</em> unite all things together\nmust be its Teacher. Yet must It use the language which this mind can\nunderstand in the condition in which it thinks it is. And It must use\nall learning to transfer illusions to the truth, taking all false ideas\nof what you are and leading you beyond them to the truth that <em>is</em>\nbeyond them. All this can very simply be reduced to this:</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> <em>What is the same can <strong>not</strong> be different,<br />\nAnd what is one can <strong>not</strong> have separate parts</em>.</p>\n\n",

Yet its frame is joined to its Creator, one with\nHim and with His masterpiece. This is its purpose, and you do not make\nthe frame into the picture when you choose to see it in its place. The\nframe that God has given it but serves His purpose, not yours apart from\nHis. It is your <em>separate</em> purpose that obscures the picture and\ncherishes the frame instead of it.

He will step forth\nfrom darkness as you look on him, and you will see the dark no more. The\ndarkness touched him not, nor you who brought him forth for you to look\nupon. His sinlessness but pictures yours. His gentleness becomes your\nstrength, and both will gladly look within and see the holiness that\nmust be there <em>because</em> of what you looked upon in him. He is the frame\nin which your holiness is set, and what God gave him must be given you.\nHowever much he overlooks the masterpiece in him and sees only a frame\nof darkness, it is still your only function to behold in him what he\nsees not. And in this seeing is the vision shared that looks on Christ\n<em>instead</em> of seeing death.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> How could the Lord of Heaven not be glad if you appreciate His\nmasterpiece? What could He do but offer thanks to you who love His Son\nas He does? Would He not make known to you His love if you but share His\npraise of what He loves? God cherishes creation as the perfect Father\nthat He is. And so His joy is made complete when any part of Him joins\nin His praise, to share His joy. This brother is His perfect gift to\nyou. And He is glad and thankful when you thank His perfect Son for\nbeing what he is. And all His thanks and gladness shine on you who would\ncomplete His joy along with Him. And thus is <em>yours</em> completed. Not one\nray of darkness can be seen by those who will to make their Father’s\nhappiness complete and theirs along with His. The gratitude of God\nHimself is freely offered to everyone who shares His purpose. It is not\nHis Will to be alone. And neither is it yours.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> Forgive your brother, and you cannot separate yourself from him nor\nfrom his Father. You <em>need</em> no forgiveness, for the wholly pure have\nnever sinned. Give then what He has given you that you may see His Son\nas one and thank his Father as He thanks you. Nor believe that all His\npraise is given not to you. For what you give is His, and giving it you\nlearn to understand His gift to you. And give the Holy Spirit what He\noffers unto the Father and the Son alike. Nothing has power over you\nexcept His Will and yours, who but extend His Will. It was for this you\nwere created and your brother with you and at one with you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> You are the same, as God Himself is one and not divided in His Will.\nAnd you must have one purpose, since He gave the same to both of you.\nHis Will is brought together as you join in will that you be made\ncomplete by offering completion to your brother. See not in him the\nsinfulness he sees, but give him honor that you may esteem yourself and\nhim. To each of you is given the power of salvation that escape from\ndarkness into light be yours to share; that you may see as one what\nnever has been separate nor apart from all God’s love as given equally.</p>\n\n",

To the extent to which\nyou recognize that guilt is meaningless, to that extent will you\nperceive attack cannot <em>be</em> justified. This is in strict accord with\nvision’s fundamental law: you see what you believe is there, and you\nbelieve it there because you <em>want</em> it there. Perception has no other\nlaw than this. The rest but stems from this, to hold it up and offer it\nsupport. This is perception’s form adapted to this world of God’s more\nbasic law that love creates itself and nothing <em>but</em> itself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> God’s laws do not obtain directly to a world perception rules, for\nsuch a world could not have been created by the Mind to which perception\nhas no meaning. Yet are His laws reflected everywhere. Not that the\nworld where this reflection is, is real at all. Only because His Son\nbelieves it is, and from His Son’s belief He could not let Himself be\nseparate entirely. He could not enter His Son’s insanity with him, but\nHe could be sure His sanity went there with him so he could not be lost\nforever in the madness of his wish.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> Perception rests on choosing; knowledge does not. Knowledge has but\none law because it has but one Creator. But this world has two who made\nit, and they do not see it as the same. To each it has a different\npurpose, and to each it is a perfect means to serve the goal for which\nit is perceived. For specialness it is the perfect frame to set it\noff—the perfect battleground to wage its wars, the perfect shelter for\nthe illusions which it would make real. Not one but it upholds in its\nperception; not one but can be fully justified.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> There is another Maker of the world, the simultaneous Corrector of\nthe mad belief that anything could be established and maintained without\nsome link that kept it still within the laws of God; not as the law\nitself upholds the universe as God created it, but in some form adapted\nto the need the Son of God believes he has. Corrected error is the\nerror’s end. And thus has God protected still His Son, even in error.\nThere is another purpose in the world that error made because it has\nanother Maker Who can reconcile its goal with His Creator’s purpose. In\nHis perception of the world, nothing is seen but justifies forgiveness\nand the sight of perfect sinlessness. Nothing arises but is met with\ninstant and complete forgiveness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> Nothing remains an instant to obscure the sinlessness that shines\nunchanged beyond the pitiful attempts of specialness to put it out of\nmind where it must be and light the body up <em>instead</em> of it. The lamps\nof Heaven are not for it to choose to see them where it will. If it\nelects to see them elsewhere from their home, as if they lit a place\nwhere they could never be, and <em>you</em> agree, then must the Maker of the\nworld correct your error, lest you remain in darkness where the lamps\nare not. Everyone here has entered darkness, yet no one has entered it\nalone. [Nor need he stay more than an instant.] For he has come with\nHeaven’s Help within him ready to lead him <em>out</em> of darkness into light\nat any time.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> The time he chooses <em>can</em> be any time, for help is there, awaiting\nbut his choice. And when he chooses to avail himself of what is given\nhim, then will he see each situation that he thought before was means to\njustify his anger turned to an event which justifies his love. He will\nhear plainly that the calls to war he heard before are really calls to\npeace. He will perceive that where he gave attack is but another altar\nwhere he can with equal ease and far more happiness bestow forgiveness.\nAnd he will reinterpret all temptation as just another chance to bring\nhim joy. How can a misperception be a sin? Let all your brother’s errors\nbe to you nothing except a chance for you to see the workings of the\nHelper given you to see the world He made, instead of yours.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> What then <em>is</em> justified? What do you <em>want</em>? For these two questions\nare the same. And when you see them <em>as</em> the same, your choice is made.\nFor it is seeing them as one that brings release from the belief there\n<em>are</em> two ways to see. This world has much to offer to your peace and\nmany chances to extend your own forgiveness. Such its purpose is to\nthose who <em>want</em> to see peace and forgiveness descend on them and offer\nthem the light.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> The Maker of the world of gentleness has perfect power to offset the\nworld of violence and hate that seems to stand between you and His\ngentleness. It is not there in His forgiving eyes. And therefore it need\nnot be there in yours. Sin is the fixed belief perception <em>cannot</em>\nchange. What has been damned is damned and damned forever, being forever\nunforgivable. If then it <em>is</em> forgiven, sin’s perception must have been\nwrong. And thus is change made possible. The Holy Spirit too sees what\nHe sees as far beyond the chance of change. But on His vision sin cannot\nencroach, for sin has been <em>corrected</em> by His sight. And thus it must\nhave been an error, not a sin. For what it claimed could never be has\nbeen. Sin is attacked by punishment and so preserved. But to forgive it\nis to change its state from error into truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> The Son of God could never sin, but he <em>can</em> wish for what would hurt\nhim. And he <em>has</em> the power to think he can be hurt. What could this be\nexcept a misperception of himself? Is this a sin or a mistake,\nforgivable or not? Does he need help or condemnation? Is it your purpose\nthat he be saved or damned? Forgetting not that what he is to you will\nmake this choice <em>your</em> future? For you make it <em>now</em>, the instant when\nall time becomes a means to reach a goal. Make then your choice. But\nrecognize that <em>in</em> this choice the purpose of the world you see is\nchosen and <em>will</em> be justified.</p>\n\n",

The need for guilt is gone because it has no purpose and is\nmeaningless without the goal of sin. Attack and sin are bound as one\nillusion, each the cause and aim and justifier of the other. Each is\nmeaningless alone, but seems to draw a meaning from the other. Each\ndepends upon the other for whatever sense it seems to have. And no one\ncould believe in one unless the other were the truth, for each attests\nthe other <em>must</em> be true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> Attack makes Christ your enemy and God along with Him. Must you not\nbe afraid with “enemies” like these? And must you not be fearful of\n<em>yourself</em>? For you have hurt yourself and made your Self your “enemy.”\nAnd now you must believe you are not you but something alien to yourself\nand “something else,” a “something” to be feared instead of loved. Who\nwould attack whatever he perceives as wholly innocent? And who,\n<em>because</em> he wishes to attack, can fail to think it must be guilty to\ndeserve the wish and leave him innocent?

It is the “enemy” confused\nwith Christ you look upon. And hate because there is no sin in him for\nyou to see. Nor do you hear his plaintive call, unchanged in content in\nwhatever form the call is made, that you unite with him and join with\nhim in innocence and peace.

In everyone you see but the reflection of what you\nchose to have him be to you. If you decide against his proper function,\nthe only one he has in truth, you are depriving him of all the joy he\nwould have found if he fulfilled the role God gave to him.

Nor can it be regained unless the way is\nshown to him through you that you may find it, walking by his side.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> It is no sacrifice that he be saved, for by his freedom will you gain\nyour own. To let his function be fulfilled is but the means to let yours\nbe. And so you walk toward Heaven or toward hell, but not alone. How\nbeautiful his sinlessness will be when you perceive it! And how great\nwill be your joy, when he is free to offer you the gift of sight God\ngave to him for you! He has no need but this—that you allow him freedom\nto complete the task God gave to him. Remembering but this—that what he\ndoes you do along with him.

But in the love he shows himself is God made free to <em>let</em>\nHis Will be done. In each of you, you see the picture of your own belief\nin what the Will of God must be for you. In your forgiveness will you\nunderstand His love for you; through your attack believe He hates you,\nthinking Heaven must be hell. Look once again upon your brother, not\nwithout the understanding that he is the way to Heaven or to hell as you\nperceive him. But forget not this—the role you give to him is given\n<em>you</em>, and you <em>will</em> walk the way you pointed out to him because it is\nyour judgment on yourself.</p>\n\n",

To each He gives a special\nfunction in salvation he alone can fill—a part for only him. Nor is the\nplan complete until he finds his special function and fulfills the part\nassigned to him to make himself complete within a world where\nincompletion rules.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> Here, where the laws of God do not prevail in perfect form, can he\nyet do <em>one</em> perfect thing and make <em>one</em> perfect choice.

It is the means the\nHoly Spirit uses to translate specialness from sin into salvation.\nForgiveness is for all. But when it rests on all, it is complete and\nevery function of this world completed with it. Then is time no more.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> Yet while in time, there is still much to do. And each must do what\nis allotted him, for on his part does <em>all</em> the plan depend. He <em>has</em> a\nspecial part in time, for so he chose, and choosing it, he made it for\nhimself. His wish was not denied but changed in form to let it serve his\nbrother <em>and</em> himself and thus become a means to save instead of lose.\nSalvation is no more than a reminder this world is not your home; its\nlaws are not imposed on you; its values are not yours. [And nothing\nthat you <em>think</em> you see in it is <em>really</em> there at all.] And this is\nseen and understood as each one takes his part in its undoing, as he did\nin making it. He has the means for either, as he always did. The\nspecialness he chose to hurt himself did God appoint to be the means for\nhis salvation from the very instant that the choice was made. His\nspecial sin was made his special grace. His special hate became his\nspecial love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> The Holy Spirit <em>needs</em> your special function that His may be\nfulfilled.

Sin is the one thing\nin all the world that <em>cannot</em> change. It is immutable. And on its\nchangelessness the world depends. The magic of the world can seem to\nhide the pain of sin from sinners and deceive with glitter and with\nguile. Yet each one knows the cost of sin is death. And so it <em>is.</em> For\nsin is a <em>request</em> for death, a wish to make this world’s foundation\nsure as love, dependable as Heaven, and as strong as God Himself. The\nworld <em>is</em> safe from love to everyone who thinks sin possible. Nor\n<em>will</em> it change. Yet <em>is</em> it possible what God created not should share\nthe attributes of His creation when it opposes it in every way?</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> It <em>cannot</em> be the “sinner’s” wish for death is just as strong as is\nGod’s Will for life. Nor can the basis of a world He did not make be\nfirm and sure as Heaven. How could it be that hell and Heaven are the\nsame? And is it possible that what He did not will cannot be changed?\nWhat is immutable besides His Will? And what can share Its attributes\nexcept Itself? What wish can rise against His Will and be immutable? If\nyou could realize <em>nothing</em> is changeless but the Will of God, this\ncourse would not be difficult for you. For it is this that you do not\nbelieve. Yet there is nothing else you <em>could</em> believe if you but looked\nat what it really is.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> Let us go back to what we said before and think of it more carefully.\nIt must be so that either God is mad or is this world a place of\nmadness. Not one Thought of His makes any sense at all within this\nworld. And nothing that the world believes as true has any meaning in\nHis Mind at all. What makes no sense and has no meaning <em>is</em> insanity.\nAnd what is madness <em>cannot</em> be the truth. If one belief so deeply\nvalued here were true, then every Thought God ever had is an illusion.\nAnd if but one Thought of His is true, then all beliefs the world gives\nany meaning to are false and make no sense at all. This <em>is</em> the choice\nyou make. Do not attempt to see it differently nor twist it into\nsomething it is not. For only this decision <em>can</em> you make. The rest is\nup to God and not to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> To justify one value that the world upholds is to deny your Father’s\nsanity and <em>yours</em>. For God and His beloved Son do not think\ndifferently. And it is the agreement of their thought that makes the Son\na co-creator with the mind Whose Thought created him. And if he chooses\nto believe one thought opposed to truth, he has decided he is not his\nFather’s Son because the Son is mad, and sanity must lie apart from both\nthe Father <em>and</em> the Son. This you <em>believe.</em> Think not that this belief\ndepends upon the form it takes. Who thinks the world is sane in <em>any</em>\nway, is justified in <em>anything</em> it thinks, or is maintained by <em>any</em>\nform of reason believes this to be true. Sin is not real <em>because</em> the\nFather and the Son are not insane. This world is meaningless <em>because</em>\nit rests on sin. Who could create the changeless if it does not rest on\ntruth?</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> The Holy Spirit has the power to change the whole foundation of the\nworld you see to something else—a basis not insane on which a sane\nperception can be based, another world perceived. And one in which\nnothing is contradicted that would lead the Son of God to sanity and\njoy. Nothing attests to death and cruelty, to separation, and to\ndifferences. For here is everything perceived as one, and no one loses\nthat each one may gain.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> Test everything that you believe against this <em>one</em> requirement. And\nunderstand that everything that meets this one demand is worthy of your\nfaith. But nothing else. What is not love is sin, and either one\nperceives the other as insane and meaningless. Love is the basis for a\nworld perceived as wholly mad to sinners who believe theirs is the way\nto sanity. But sin is equally insane within the sight of love, whose\ngentle eyes would look beyond the madness and rest peacefully on truth.\nEach sees a world immutable, as each defines the changeless and eternal\ntruth of what you are. And each reflects a view of what the Father and\nthe Son must be to make that viewpoint meaningful and sane.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Your special function is the special form in which the fact that God\nis not insane appears most sensible and meaningful to you. The content\nis the same. The form is suited to your special needs and to the special\ntime and place in which you think you find yourself and where you can be\nfree of place and time and all that you believe must limit you. The Son\nof God cannot be bound by time nor place nor anything God did not will.\nYet if His Will is seen as madness, then the form of sanity which makes\nit most acceptable to those who are insane requires special choice. Nor\ncan this choice be made <em>by</em> the insane, whose problem is their choices\nare not free and made with reason in the light of sense.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> It <em>would</em> be madness to entrust salvation to the insane. Because He\nis <em>not</em> mad has God appointed One as sane as He to raise a saner world\nto meet the sight of everyone who chose insanity as his salvation. To\nthis One is given the choice of form most suitable to him; one which\nwill not attack the world he sees, but enter into it in quietness and\n<em>show</em> him he is mad. This One but points to an alternative, <em>another</em>\nway of looking at what he has seen before and recognizes as the world in\nwhich he lives and thought he understood before.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> Now <em>must</em> he question this because the form of the alternative is\none which he cannot deny nor overlook nor fail completely to perceive at\nall. To each his special function is designed to be perceived as\npossible and more and more desired as it <em>proves</em> to him that it is an\nalternative he really <em>wants.</em> From this position does his sinfulness\nand all the sin he sees within the world offer him less and less— until\nhe comes to understand it <em>cost</em> him his sanity and stands between him\nand whatever hope he has of <em>being</em> sane. Nor is he left without escape\nfrom madness, for he has a special part in everyone’s escape. He can no\nmore be left outside without a special function in the hope of peace\nthan could the Father overlook His Son and pass him by in careless\nthoughtlessness.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> What is dependable <em>except</em> God’s Love? And where does sanity abide\n<em>except</em> in Him? The One Who speaks for Him can show you this in the\nalternative He chose especially for you. It is God’s Will that you\nremember this and so emerge from deepest mourning into perfect joy.\nAccept the function that has been assigned to you in God’s Own plan to\nshow His Sons that hell and Heaven are different, <em>not</em> the same. And\nthat in Heaven <em>they</em> are all the same, without the differences which\nwould have made a hell of Heaven and a heaven of hell, had such insanity\nbeen possible.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> The whole belief that someone loses but reflects the underlying tenet\nGod must be insane. For in this world, it seems that one must gain\n<em>because</em> another lost. If <em>this</em> were true, then God is mad indeed! But\nwhat is this belief except a form of the more basic tenet, “Sin is real\nand rules the world”? For every little gain must someone lose and pay\nexact amount in blood and suffering. For otherwise would evil triumph\nand destruction be the total cost of any gain at all. You who believe\nthat God is mad, look carefully at this and understand that it must be\nthat either God or <em>this</em> must be insane, but hardly both.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> Salvation is rebirth of the idea no one <em>can</em> lose for anyone to\ngain. And everyone <em>must</em> gain if anyone would be a gainer. Here is\nsanity restored. And on this single rock of truth can faith in God’s\neternal saneness rest in perfect confidence and perfect peace. Reason is\nsatisfied, for all insane beliefs can be corrected here. And sin <em>must</em>\nbe impossible if <em>this</em> is true. This is the rock on which salvation\nrests, the vantage point from which the Holy Spirit gives meaning and\ndirection to the plan in which your special function has a part. For\nhere your special function is made whole because it shares the\n<em>function</em> of the whole.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> Remember all temptation is but this—a mad belief that God’s insanity\nwould make you sane and give you what you want. That either God or you\nmust lose to madness because your aims can <em>not</em> be reconciled. Death\ndemands life, but life is not maintained at any cost. No one can suffer\nfor the Will of God to be fulfilled. Salvation is His Will <em>because</em> you\nshare it. Not for you alone but for the Self which is the Son of God. He\n<em>cannot</em> lose, for if he could, the loss would be his Father’s, and in\nHim no loss is possible. And this is sane <em>because</em> it is the truth.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>63</sup> The Holy Spirit can use all that you give to Him for your salvation.\nBut He cannot use what you withhold, for He cannot take it from you\nwithout your willingness. For if He did, you would believe He wrested it\nfrom you against your will. And so you would not learn it <em>is</em> your will\nto be without it. You need not give it to Him wholly willingly, for if\nyou could, you’d have no need of Him. But this He needs—that you prefer\nHe take it than that you keep it for yourself alone and recognize that\nwhat brings loss to no one you would not know. This much is necessary to\nadd to the idea no one can lose for you to gain. And nothing more.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> Here is the only principle salvation needs. Nor is it necessary that\nyour faith in it be strong, unswerving, and without attack from all\nbeliefs opposed to it. You <em>have</em> no fixed allegiance. But remember\nsalvation is not needed by the saved. You are not called upon to do what\none divided still against himself would find impossible. Have little\nfaith that wisdom could be found in such a state of mind. But be you\nthankful that only little faith is <em>asked</em> of you. What <em>but</em> a little\nfaith remains to those who still believe in sin? What could they know of\nHeaven and the justice of the saved?</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> There is a kind of justice in salvation of which the world knows\nnothing. To the world, justice and <em>vengeance</em> are the same, for sinners\nsee justice only as their punishment, perhaps sustained by someone else\nbut not escaped. The laws of sin <em>demand</em> a victim. Who it may be makes\nlittle difference. But death must be the cost and must be paid. This is\nnot justice but insanity. Yet how could justice be defined without\ninsanity where love means hate and death is seen as victory and triumph\nover eternity and timelessness and life?</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> You who know not of justice still can ask and learn the answer.\nJustice looks on all in the same way. It is not just that one should\nlack for what another has. For that is vengeance in whatever form it\ntakes. Justice demands <em>no</em> sacrifice, for any sacrifice is made that\nsin may be preserved and kept. It is a payment offered for the cost of\nsin, but not the total cost. The rest is taken from another, to be laid\nbeside your little payment to “atone” for all that you would keep and\nnot give up. So is the victim seen as partly you, with someone else by\nfar the greater part. And in the total cost, the greater his, the less\nis yours. And justice, being blind, is satisfied by being paid, it\nmatters not by whom. Can this <em>be</em> justice? God knows not of this. But\njustice <em>does</em> He know and knows it well. For He is wholly fair to\neveryone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> Vengeance is alien to God’s Mind <em>because</em> He knows of justice. To be\njust is to be fair and <em>not</em> be vengeful. Fairness and vengeance are\nimpossible, for each one contradicts the other and denies that it is\nreal. It is impossible for you to share the Holy Spirit’s justice with a\nmind that can conceive of specialness at all. Yet how could He be just\nif He condemns a sinner for the crimes he did not do but <em>thinks</em> he\ndid? And where would justice be if He demanded of the ones obsessed with\nthe idea of punishment that they lay it aside unaided and perceive it is\nnot true? It is extremely hard for those who still believe sin\nmeaningful to understand the Holy Spirit’s justice.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> They <em>must</em> believe He shares their own confusion and cannot avoid\nthe vengeance that their own belief in justice must entail. And so they\nfear the Holy Spirit and perceive the “wrath” of God in Him. [They are\nunjust indeed to Him.] Nor can they trust Him not to strike them dead\nwith lightning bolts torn from the “fires” of Heaven by God’s own angry\nhand. They <em>do</em> believe that Heaven is hell and <em>are</em> afraid of love.\nAnd deep suspicion and the chill of fear comes over them when they are\ntold that they have never sinned. Their world depends on sin’s\nstability. And they perceive the “threat” of what God knows as justice\nto be more destructive to themselves and to their world than vengeance,\nwhich they understand and love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> So do they think the loss of sin a curse. And flee [the blessing\nof] the Holy Spirit as if He were a messenger from hell sent from above\nin treachery and guile to work God’s vengeance on them in the guise of a\ndeliverer and friend. What could He be to them except a devil dressed to\ndeceive within an angel’s cloak? And what escape has He for them except\na door to hell that seems to look like Heaven’s gate?</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> Yet justice cannot punish those who ask for punishment but have a\nJudge Who knows that they are wholly innocent in truth. In justice, He\nis bound to set them free and give them all the honor they deserve and\nhave denied themselves because they are not fair and cannot understand\nthat they are innocent. Love is not understandable to sinners because\nthey think that justice is split off from love and stands for something\nelse.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> And thus is love perceived as weak and vengeance strong. For love has\n<em>lost</em> when judgment left its side and is too weak to save from\npunishment. But vengeance without love has <em>gained</em> in strength by being\nseparate and apart from love. And what but vengeance now can help and\nsave, while love stands feebly by with helpless hands, bereft of justice\nand vitality and powerless to save? What can Love ask of you who think\nthat all of this is true? Could He, in justice and in love believe in\nyour confusion you have much to give? You are not asked to trust Him\nfar. No further than what you see He offers you and what you recognize\nyou could not give yourself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> In God’s own justice does He recognize all you deserve but\nunderstands as well that you cannot accept it for yourself. It is His\nspecial function to hold out to you the gifts the innocent <em>deserve.</em>\nAnd every one that you accept brings joy to Him as well as you. He knows\nthat Heaven is richer made by each one you accept. And God rejoices as\nHis Son receives what loving justice knows to be his due. For love and\njustice are <em>not</em> different. <em>Because</em> they are the same does mercy\nstand at God’s right hand and give the Son of God the power to forgive\n<em>himself</em> of sin.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> To him who merits everything, how can it be that anything be kept\nfrom him? For that would be injustice and unfair indeed to all the\nholiness that is in him, however much he recognize it not. God knows of\nno injustice. He would not allow His Son be judged by those who seek his\ndeath and could not see his worth at all. What honest witnesses could\nthey call forth to speak on his behalf? And who would come to plead for\nhim and not against his life? No justice would be given him by you. Yet\nGod ensured that justice <em>would</em> be done unto the Son He loves and would\nprotect from all unfairness you might seek to offer, believing vengeance\n<em>is</em> his proper due.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> As specialness cares not who pays the cost of sin, so it be paid, the\nHoly Spirit heeds not who looks on innocence at last, provided it is\nseen and recognized. For just <em>one</em> witness is enough if he sees truly.\nSimple justice asks no more. Of each one does the Holy Spirit ask if he\nwill be that one, so justice may return to love and there be satisfied.\nEach special function He allots is but for this—that each one learn that\nlove and justice are not separate. And both are strengthened by their\nunion with each other. Without love is justice prejudiced and weak. And\nlove without justice is impossible. For love is fair and cannot chasten\nwithout cause. What cause can <em>be</em> to warrant an attack upon the\ninnocent? In justice then does love correct mistakes, but not in\nvengeance. For that would be unjust to innocence.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> You can be perfect witness to the power of love <em>and</em> justice if you\nunderstand it is impossible the Son of God could merit vengeance. You\nneed not perceive in every circumstance that this is true. Nor need you\nlook to your experience within the world, which is but shadows of all\nthat is <em>really</em> happening within yourself. The understanding which you\nneed comes not of you but from a larger Self, so great and holy that He\ncould not doubt His innocence. Your special function is a call to Him\nthat He may smile on you whose sinlessness He shares. <em>His</em>\nunderstanding will be <em>yours.</em> And so the Holy Spirit’s special function\nhas been fulfilled. God’s Son has found a witness unto his sinlessness\nand not his sin. How little need you give the Holy Spirit that simple\njustice may be given you!</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> Without impartiality there is no justice. How can specialness be\njust? Judge not because you cannot, not because you are a miserable\nsinner too. How can the special <em>really</em> understand that justice is the\nsame for everyone? To take from one to give another must be an injustice\nto them both, since they are equal in the Holy Spirit’s sight. Their\nFather gave the same inheritance to both. Who would have more or less is\nnot aware that he has everything. He is no judge of what must be\nanother’s due, because he thinks <em>he</em> is deprived. And so must he be\nenvious and try to take away from whom he judges. He is not impartial\nand cannot fairly see another’s rights because his own have been\nobscured to him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> You have the <em>right</em> to all the universe—to perfect peace, complete\ndeliverance from all effects of sin, and to the life eternal, joyous and\ncomplete in every way, as God appointed for His holy Son. This is the\nonly justice Heaven knows, and all the Holy Spirit brings to earth. Your\nspecial function shows you nothing else but perfect justice <em>can</em>\nprevail for you. And you are safe from vengeance in all forms. The world\ndeceives, but it cannot replace God’s justice with a version of its own.\nFor only love <em>is</em> just and <em>can</em> perceive what justice must accord the\nSon of God. Let love decide and never fear that you in your unfairness\nwill deprive yourself of what God’s justice has allotted you.</p>\n\n",

And what could this mean except that they\nare sins and not mistakes, forever uncorrectable, and to be met with\nvengeance not with justice? Are you willing to be released from all\neffects of sin? You cannot answer this until you see all that the answer\nmust entail. For if you answer “yes,” it means you will forgo all values\nof this world in favor of the peace of Heaven. Not <em>one</em> sin would you\nretain. And not <em>one</em> doubt that this is possible will you hold dear\nthat sin be kept in place. You mean that truth has greater value now\nthan <em>all</em> illusions. And you recognize that truth must be revealed to\nyou because you know not what it is.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> To give reluctantly is not to gain the gift because you are reluctant\nto <em>accept</em> it. It is saved for you until reluctance to receive it\ndisappears and you are willing it be given you. God’s justice warrants\ngratitude, not fear. Nothing you give is lost to you or anyone, but\ncherished and preserved [for you] in Heaven, where all of the\ntreasures given to God’s Son are kept for him and offered anyone who but\nholds out his hand in willingness they be received. Nor is the treasure\nless as it is given out. Each gift [received] but <em>adds</em> to the\nsupply. For God is fair. He does not fight against His Son’s reluctance\nto perceive salvation as a gift from Him. Yet would His justice not be\nsatisfied until it is received by everyone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> Be certain any answer to a problem the Holy Spirit solves will always\nbe one in which no one loses. And this must be true because He asks no\nsacrifice of anyone. An answer which demands the slightest loss to\nanyone has not resolved the problem but has added to it and made it\ngreater, harder to resolve, and <em>more</em> unfair. It is impossible the Holy\nSpirit could see unfairness as a resolution. To Him, what is unfair must\nbe corrected <em>because</em> it is unfair. And every error is a perception in\nwhich one at least is seen unfairly. Thus is justice not accorded to the\nSon of God. When anyone is seen as losing, he has been condemned. And\npunishment becomes his due instead of justice.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> The sight of innocence makes punishment impossible and justice sure.\nThe Holy Spirit’s perception leaves no ground for an attack. Only a\n<em>loss</em> could justify attack, and loss of any kind He cannot see. The\nworld solves problems in another way. It sees a resolution as a state in\nwhich it is decided who shall win and who shall lose—how much the one\nshall take and how much can the loser still defend.</p>\n\n<p><sup>82</sup> Yet does the problem still remain unsolved, for <em>only</em> justice can\nset up a state in which there is no loser, no one left unfairly treated\nand deprived, and thus with grounds for vengeance. Problem solving\ncannot be vengeance, which at best can bring another problem added to\nthe first, in which the murder is not obvious. The Holy Spirit’s problem\nsolving is the way in which the problem <em>ends.</em> It has been solved\n<em>because</em> it has been met with justice. Until it has, it will recur\nbecause it has not yet been solved. The principle that justice means no\none can lose is crucial to this course. For miracles <em>depend</em> on\njustice. Not as it is seen through this world’s eyes, but as God knows\nit, and as knowledge is reflected in the sight the Holy Spirit gives.</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> <em>No one</em> deserves to lose. And what would be unjust to him cannot\noccur. Healing must be for everyone <em>because</em> he does not merit an\nattack of any kind. What order can there be in miracles, unless someone\ndeserves to suffer more and others less? And <em>is</em> this justice to the\nwholly innocent? A miracle <em>is</em> justice. It is not a special gift to\nsome to be withheld from others as less worthy, more condemned, and thus\napart from healing. Who is there who can be separate from salvation if\nits <em>purpose</em> is the end of specialness? Where is salvation’s justice if\nsome errors are unforgivable and warrant vengeance in place of healing\nand return of peace?</p>\n\n<p><sup>84</sup> Salvation cannot seek to help God’s Son be more unfair than <em>he</em> has\nsought to be. If miracles, the Holy Spirit’s gift, were given specially\nto an elect and special group and kept apart from others as less\ndeserving, then is He <em>ally</em> to specialness. What He cannot perceive He\nbears no witness to. And everyone is equally entitled to His gift of\nhealing and deliverance and peace. To give a problem to the Holy Spirit\nto solve for you means that you <em>want</em> it solved. To keep it for\nyourself to solve without His help is to decide it should remain\nunsettled, unresolved, and lasting in its power of injustice and attack.\nNo one <em>can</em> be unjust to you, unless you have decided first to <em>be</em>\nunjust. And then must problems rise to block your way and peace be\nscattered by the winds of hate.</p>\n\n<p><sup>85</sup> Unless you think that all your brothers have an equal right to\nmiracles with you, you will not claim your right to them because you\nwere unjust to one with equal rights. Seek to deny, and you <em>will</em> feel\ndenied. Seek to deprive, and you <em>have</em> been deprived. A miracle can\n<em>never</em> be received because another could receive it <em>not</em>. Only\nforgiveness offers miracles. And pardon must be just to everyone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>86</sup> The little problems that you keep and hide become your secret sins\nbecause you did not choose to let them be removed for you. And so they\ngather dust and grow until they cover everything that you perceive and\nleave you fair to no one. Not one right do you believe you have. And\nbitterness, with vengeance justified and mercy lost, condemns you as\nunworthy of forgiveness. The unforgiven <em>have</em> no mercy to bestow upon\nanother. That is why your sole responsibility must be to take\nforgiveness for yourself. The miracle that you receive, you <em>give</em>. Each\none becomes an illustration of the law on which salvation rests—that\njustice must be done to all if anyone is to be healed. No one can lose,\nand everyone <em>must</em> benefit.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> Each miracle is an example of what justice can accomplish when it is\noffered to everyone alike. It is received and given equally. It is\nawareness that giving and receiving are the same. Because it does not\nmake the same unlike, it sees no differences where none exist. And thus\nit is the same for everyone, because it sees no differences in <em>them.</em>\nIts offering is universal, and it teaches but one message:</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> <em>What is God’s <strong>belongs</strong> to everyone and <strong>is</strong> his due.</em></p>\n\n",

And let the world recede and take\nthe rest his witness offers on behalf of peace. But judge him not, for\nyou will hear no song of liberation for yourself nor see what it is\ngiven him to witness to that you may see it and rejoice with him.

He has not greater\ndifficulty in resolving some than others. Every problem is the same to\nHim, because each one is solved in just the <em>same</em> respect and through\nthe <em>same</em> approach. The aspects which need solving do not change,\nwhatever form the problem seems to take. A problem can appear in many\nforms, and it will do so while the problem lasts. It serves no purpose\nto attempt to solve it in a special form. It will recur and then recur\nagain and yet again until it has been answered for all time and will not\nrise again in any form. And only then are you released from it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> The Holy Spirit offers you release from <em>every</em> problem that you\nthink you have. They are the same to Him because each one, regardless of\nthe form it seems to take, is a demand that someone suffer loss and make\na sacrifice that you might gain. And when the situation is worked out so\nno one loses, is the problem gone, because it was an error in perception\nwhich now has been corrected. One mistake is not more difficult for Him\nto bring to truth than is another. For there <em>is</em> but one mistake—the\nwhole idea that loss is possible and could result in gain for anyone. If\nthis were true, then God would be unfair, sin would be possible, attack\nbe justified, and vengeance fair.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> This one mistake in any form has <em>one</em> correction. There <em>is</em> no\nloss; to think there is, is a mistake. You <em>have</em> no problems, though\nyou think you have.

It does injustice to the Son of God and therefore is not true.\nThe Holy Spirit does not evaluate injustices as great or small or more\nor less. They have no properties to Him. They are mistakes from which\nthe Son of God is suffering, but needlessly. And so He takes the thorns\nand nails away. He does not pause to judge whether the hurt be large or\nlittle. He makes but one judgment—that to hurt God’s Son <em>must</em> be\nunfair and therefore is not so.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> You who believe it safe to give but some mistakes to be corrected\nwhile you keep the others to yourself, remember this: justice is total.\nThere is no such thing as partial justice. If the Son of God is guilty,\nthen is he condemned, and he deserves no mercy from the God of justice.\nBut ask not God to punish him because <em>you</em> find him guilty and would\nhave him die. God offers you the means to see his innocence. Would it be\nfair to punish him because you will not look at what is there to see?\nEach time you keep a problem for yourself to solve or judge that it is\none which has no resolution, you have made it great and past the hope of\nhealing. You deny the miracle of justice <em>can</em> be fair.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> If God is just, then can there be no problems that justice cannot\nsolve. But you believe that some injustices are fair and good and\nnecessary to preserve yourself. It is these problems that you think are\ngreat and cannot be resolved. For there are those you <em>want</em> to suffer\nloss and no one whom you wish to be preserved from sacrifice entirely.\nConsider once again your special function. <em>One</em> is given you to see in\nhim his perfect sinlessness. And you will ask no sacrifice of him\nbecause you could not will he suffer loss. The miracle of justice you\ncall forth will rest on you as surely as on him. Nor will the Holy\nSpirit be content until it is received by everyone. For what you give to\nHim <em>is</em> everyone’s, and by your giving it can He ensure that everyone\nreceives it equally.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> Think then how great your own release will be when you are willing to\nreceive correction for all your problems. You will not keep one, for\npain in any form you will not want. And you will see each little hurt\nresolved before the Holy Spirit’s gentle sight. For all of them <em>are</em>\nlittle in His sight and worth no more than just a tiny sigh before they\ndisappear, to be forever undone and unremembered. What seemed once to be\na special problem, a mistake without a remedy, or an affliction without\na cure has been transformed into a universal blessing. Sacrifice is\ngone. And in its place the love of God can be remembered and will shine\naway all memory of sacrifice and loss.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> God cannot be remembered until justice is loved instead of feared. He\ncannot be unjust to anyone or anything because He knows that everything\nthat is belongs to Him and will forever be as He created it. Nothing He\nloves but must be sinless and beyond attack. Your special function opens\nwide the door beyond which is the memory of His love kept perfectly\nintact and undefiled. And all you need to do is but to wish that Heaven\nbe given you instead of hell, and every bolt and barrier that seems to\nhold the door securely barred and locked will merely fall away and\ndisappear. For it is not your Father’s Will that you should offer or\nreceive less than He gave when He created you in perfect love.</p>\n\n",

He knows of <em>one</em> creation, <em>one</em> reality, <em>one</em> truth, and but\n<em>one</em> Son. Nothing conflicts with oneness. How, then, could there be\ncomplexity in Him? What is there to decide? For it is conflict that\nmakes choice [complex]. The truth is simple—it is one, without an\nopposite. And how could strife enter in its simple presence and bring\ncomplexity where oneness is? The truth makes no decisions, for there is\nnothing to decide <em>between</em>. And only if there were could choosing be a\nnecessary step in the advance toward oneness. What is everything leaves\nroom for nothing else.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> Yet is this magnitude beyond the scope of this curriculum. Nor is it\nnecessary we dwell on anything that cannot be immediately grasped. There\nis a borderland of thought which stands between this world and Heaven.\nIt is not a place, and when you reach it is apart from time. Here is the\nmeeting-place where thoughts are brought together—where conflicting\nvalues meet and all illusions are laid down beside the truth where they\nare judged to be untrue. This borderland is just beyond the gate of\nHeaven. Here is every thought made pure and wholly simple. Here <em>is</em> sin\ndenied and everything that <em>is</em> received instead.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> This is the journey’s end. We have referred to it as the “real\nworld.” And yet there is a contradiction here in that the words imply a\nlimited reality, a partial truth, a segment of the universe made true.\nThis is because knowledge makes no attack upon perception. They are\nbrought together, and only one continues past the gate where Oneness is.\nSalvation is a borderland where place and time and choice have meaning\nstill, and yet it can be seen that they are temporary, out of place, and\nevery choice has been already made.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> Nothing the Son of God believes can be destroyed. But what is truth\nto him must be brought to the last comparison that he will ever make,\nthe last evaluation that will be possible, the final judgment upon this\nworld. It is the judgment of the truth upon illusion, of knowledge on\nperception—it has no meaning and does not exist. This is not your\ndecision. It is but a simple statement of a simple fact. But in this\nworld, there <em>are</em> no simple facts because what is the same and what is\ndifferent remain unclear. The one essential thing to make a choice at\nall is this distinction. And herein lies the difference between the\nworlds. In this one, choice is made impossible. In the real world is\nchoosing simplified.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> Salvation stops just short of Heaven, for only perception needs\nsalvation. Heaven was never lost and so cannot be saved. Yet who can\nmake a choice between the wish for Heaven and the wish for hell unless\nhe recognizes they are <em>not</em> the same? This difference is the learning\ngoal this course has set. It will not go beyond this aim. Its only\npurpose is to teach what is the same and what is different, leaving room\nto make the only choice which <em>can</em> be made.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> There is no basis for choice in this complex and over-complicated\nworld. For no one understands what is the same and seems to choose where\nno choice really is. The real world is the area of choice made real, not\nin the outcome but in the perception of <em>alternatives</em> for choice. That\nthere <em>is</em> choice is an illusion. Yet within this one lies the undoing\nof <em>every</em> illusion, not excepting this.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> Is not this like your special function, where the separation is\nundone by change of purpose in what once was specialness and now is\nunion? <em>All</em> illusions are but one. And in the recognition this is so\nlies the ability to give up all attempts to choose between them and to\n<em>make</em> them different. [How simple is the choice between two things so\nclearly <em>un</em>alike.] There <em>is</em> no conflict here. No sacrifice is\npossible in the relinquishment of an illusion <em>recognized</em> as such.\nWhere all reality has been withdrawn from what was never true, can it be\nhard to give it up and choose what <em>must</em> be true?</p>\n\n",

It\ntranslates the world of sin into a simple world where justice can be\nreflected from beyond the gate behind which total lack of limits lies.\nNothing in boundless love could need forgiveness. And what is charity\nwithin the world gives way to simple justice past the gate that opens\ninto Heaven. No one forgives unless he has believed in sin and still\nbelieves that he has much to be forgiven. Forgiveness thus becomes the\nmeans by which he learns he has done nothing to forgive. Forgiveness\nalways rests upon the one who offers it until he sees himself as needing\nit no more. And thus is he returned to his real function of creating,\nwhich his forgiveness offers him again.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> Forgiveness turns the world of sin into a world of glory, wonderful\nto see. Each flower shines in light, and every bird sings of the joy of\nHeaven. There is no sadness, and there is no parting here, for\neverything is totally forgiven. And what has been forgiven must join,\nfor nothing stands between to keep them separate and apart. The sinless\nmust perceive that they are one, for nothing stands between to push the\nother off. And in the space which sin left vacant do they join as one,\nin gladness recognizing what is part of them has not been kept apart and\nseparate.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> The holy place on which you stand is but the space that sin has left.\nAnd here you see the face of Christ arising in its place. Who could\nbehold the face of Christ and not recall His Father as He really is? Who\ncould fear love and stand upon the ground where sin has left a place for\nHeaven’s altar to rise and tower far above the world and reach beyond\nthe universe to touch the heart of all creation? What is Heaven but a\nsong of gratitude and love and praise by everything created to the\nSource of its creation? The holiest of altars is set where once sin was\nbelieved to be. And here does every light of heaven come to be rekindled\nand increased in joy. For here is what was lost restored to them and all\ntheir radiance made whole again.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> Forgiveness brings no little miracles to lay before the gate of\nHeaven. Here the Son of God Himself comes to receive each gift that\nbrings him nearer to his home. Not one is lost, and none is cherished\nmore than any other. Each reminds him of His Father’s love as surely as\nthe rest. And each one teaches him that what he fear[s,] he loves the\nmost. What <em>but</em> a miracle could change his mind, so that he understands\nthat love cannot <em>be</em> feared? What other miracle is there but this? And\nwhat else <em>need</em> there be to make the space between you disappear?</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> Where sin once was perceived will rise a world which will become an\naltar to the truth, and <em>you</em> will join the lights of Heaven there and\nsing their song of gratitude and praise. And as they come to you to be\ncomplete, so will you go with them. For no one hears the song of Heaven\nand remains without a voice that adds its power to the song and makes it\nsweeter still. And each one joins the singing at the altar which was\nraised within the tiny spot that sin proclaimed to be its own. And what\nwas tiny then has soared into a magnitude of song in which the universe\nhas joined with but a single voice. This tiny spot of sin that stands\nbetween you still is holding back the happy opening of Heaven’s gate.\nHow little is the hindrance which withholds the wealth of Heaven from\nyou!

    "content": "<p><sup>30</sup> A little hindrance can seem large indeed to those who do not\nunderstand that miracles are all the same. Yet teaching that is what\nthis course is <em>for</em>. This is its only purpose, for only that is all\nthere is to learn. And you can learn it many different ways. All\nlearning is a help or hindrance to the gate of Heaven. Nothing in\nbetween is possible. There are two teachers only, who point in different\nways. And you will go along the way your chosen teacher leads. There are\nbut two directions you can take while time remains and choice is\nmeaningful. For never will another road be made except the way to\nHeaven. You but choose whether to go <em>toward</em> Heaven or away to nowhere.\nThere <em>is</em> nothing else to choose.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> Nothing is ever lost but time, which in the end is [nothing. It] is\nbut a little hindrance to eternity, quite meaningless to the real\nTeacher of the world. Yet since you <em>do</em> believe in [its reality], why\nshould you waste it going nowhere when it <em>can</em> be used to reach a goal\nas high as learning can achieve? Think not the way to Heaven’s gate is\ndifficult at all. Nothing you undertake with certain purpose and high\nresolve and happy confidence, holding each other’s hand and keeping step\nto Heaven’s song, is difficult to do. But it is hard indeed to wander\noff, alone and miserable, down a road which leads to nothing and which\nhas no purpose.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> God gave His Teacher to replace the one you made, not to conflict\nwith it. And what He would replace has been replaced. Time lasted but an\ninstant in your mind, with no effect upon eternity. And so is all time\npassed and everything exactly as it was before the way to nothingness\nwas made. The tiny tick of time in which the first mistake was made, and\nall of them within that one mistake, held also the <em>Correction</em> for that\none and all of them that came within the first. And in that tiny instant\ntime was gone, for that was all it ever was. What God gave Answer to\n<em>is</em> answered and is gone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> To you who still believe you live in time and know not it is gone,\nthe Holy Spirit still guides you through the infinitely small and\nsenseless maze you still perceive in time, though it has long since\ngone. You think you live in what is past. Each thing you look upon you\nsaw but for an instant, long ago before its unreality gave way to truth.\nNot one illusion still remains unanswered in your mind. Uncertainty was\nbrought to certainty so long ago that it is hard indeed to hold it to\nyour heart as if it were before you still.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> The tiny instant you would keep and make eternal passed away in\nHeaven too soon for anything to notice it had come. What disappeared too\nquickly to affect the simple knowledge of the Son of God can hardly\nstill be there for you to choose to be your teacher. Only in the past—an\nancient past, too short to make a world in answer to creation—did this\nworld appear to rise. So very long ago, for such a tiny interval of time\nthat not one note in Heaven’s song was missed.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> Yet in each unforgiving act or thought, in every judgment, and in all\nbelief in sin, is that one instant still called back, as if it could be\nmade again in time. You keep an ancient memory before your eyes. And he\nwho lives in memories alone is unaware of where he is.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> [Forgiveness is the great release from time. It is the key to\nlearning that the past is over. Madness speaks no more. There <em>is</em> no\nother teacher and no <em>other</em> way. For what has been undone no longer is.\nAnd who can stand upon a distant shore and dream himself across an ocean\nto a place and time that have long since gone by? How <em>real</em> a hindrance\ncan this dream be to where he really <em>is</em>? For this is fact and does\n<em>not</em> change whatever dreams he has. Yet can he still <em>imagine</em> he is\nelsewhere and in another time. In the extreme, he can delude himself\nthat this is true and pass from mere imagining into belief and into\nmadness, quite convinced that where he would prefer to be, he <em>is</em>.]</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> Is this a <em>hindrance</em> to the place whereon he stands? Is any echo\nfrom the past that he may hear a fact in what is there to hear where he\nis now? And how much can his own delusions about time and place affect a\nchange in where he really is? The unforgiven is a voice that calls out\nfrom a past forever more gone by. And everything which points to it as\nreal is but a wish that what is gone could be made real again and seen\nas here and now in place of what is <em>really</em> now and here. Is this a\nhindrance to the truth the past is gone and cannot be returned to you?\nAnd do you <em>want</em> that fearful instant kept, when Heaven seemed to\ndisappear and God was feared and made a symbol of your hate?</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> Forget the time of terror that has been so long ago corrected and\nundone. Can sin withstand the Will of God? Can it be up to you to see\nthe past and put it in the present? You can <em>not</em> go back. And\neverything that points the way in the direction of the past but sets you\non a mission whose accomplishment can only be unreal. Such is the\njustice your ever-loving Father has ensured must come to you. And from\nyour own unfairness to yourself has He protected you. You <em>cannot</em> lose\nyour way because there is no way but His and nowhere can you go except\nto Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> Would God allow His Son to lose his way along a road long since a\nmemory of time gone by? [This course will teach you only what is now.]\nA dreadful instant in a distant past, now perfectly corrected, is of no\nconcern nor value. Let the dead and gone be peacefully forgotten.\nResurrection has come to take its place. And now you are a part of\nresurrection, <em>not</em> of death. No past illusions have the power to keep\nyou in a place of death, a vault God’s Son entered an instant, to be\ninstantly restored unto His Father’s perfect Love. And how can he be\nkept in chains long since removed and gone forever from his mind?</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> The Son that God created is as free as God created him. He was reborn\nthe instant that he chose to die instead of live. And will you not\nforgive him now because he made an error in the past that God remembers\nnot and is not there? Now you are shifting back and forth between the\npast and present. Sometimes the past seems real, as if it were the\npresent. Voices from the past are heard and then are doubted. You are\nlike to one who still hallucinates but lacks conviction in what he\nperceives. This is the borderland between the worlds, the bridge between\nthe past and present. Here the shadow of the past remains, but still a\npresent light is dimly recognized. Once it is seen, this light can never\nbe forgotten. It must draw you from the past into the present, where you\nreally <em>are</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> The shadow voices do not change the laws of time or of eternity. They\ncome from what is past and gone and hinder not the true existence of the\nhere and now. The real world is the second part of the hallucination\ntime and death are real and have existence which can <em>be</em> perceived.\nThis terrible illusion was denied in but the time it took for God to\ngive His answer to illusion for all time and every circumstance. And\nthen it was no more, to be experienced as there.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> Each day and every minute in each day and every instant that each\nminute holds, you but relive the single instant when the time of terror\nwas replaced by love. And so you die each day to live again until you\ncross the gap between past and present, which is not a gap at all. Such\nis each life—a seeming interval from birth to death and on to life\nagain, a repetition of an instant gone by long ago, which cannot <em>be</em>\nrelived. And all of time is but the mad belief that what is over is\nstill here and now.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> Forgive the past and let it go, for it <em>is</em> gone. You stand no longer\non the ground that lies between the worlds. You have gone on and reached\nthe world that lies at Heaven’s gate. There is no hindrance to the Will\nof God nor any need that you repeat again a journey that was over long\nago. Look gently on each other and behold the world in which perception\nof your hate has been transformed into a world of love.</p>",

    "content": "<p><sup>47</sup> This is a course in miracles. And as such, the laws of healing must\nbe understood before the purpose of the course can be accomplished. Let\nus review the principles that we have covered and arrange them in a way\nthat summarizes all that must occur for healing to be possible. For when\nit once is possible, it <em>must</em> occur. All sickness comes from\nseparation. When the separation is denied, it goes. For it <em>is</em> gone as\nsoon as the idea which brought it has been healed and been replaced by\nsanity. Sickness and sin are seen as consequence and cause in a\nrelationship kept hidden from awareness that it may be carefully\npreserved from reason’s light.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> Guilt <em>asks</em> for punishment, and its request is granted—not in truth\nbut in the world of shadows and illusions built on sin. The Son of God\nperceives what he would see, because perception <em>is</em> a wish fulfilled.\nPerception changes, made to take the place of changeless knowledge. Yet\nis truth unchanged. It cannot be perceived, but only known. What is\nperceived takes many forms, but none has meaning. Brought to truth, its\nsenselessness is quite apparent. Kept apart from truth, it seems to have\na meaning and be real.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> Perception’s laws are opposite to truth, and what is true of\nknowledge is not true of anything that is apart from it. Yet has God\ngiven answer to the world of sickness which applies to <em>all</em> its forms.\nGod’s answer is eternal, though it operates in time where it is needed.\nYet because it <em>is</em> of God, the laws of time do not affect its workings.\nIt is in this world, but not a part of it. For it is real and dwells\nwhere all reality must be. Ideas leave not their source, and their\neffects but seem to be apart from them. Ideas are of the mind. What is\nprojected out and seems to be external to the mind is not outside at all\nbut an effect of what is in and has not left its source.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> God’s answer lies where the belief in sin must be, for only there can\nits effects be utterly undone and without cause. Perception’s laws must\nbe reversed, because they <em>are</em> reversals of the laws of truth. The laws\nof truth forever will be true and cannot <em>be</em> reversed, yet can be\n<em>seen</em> as upside-down. And this must be corrected where the illusion of\nreversal lies.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> It is impossible that one illusion be less amenable to truth than are\nthe rest. But it <em>is</em> possible that some are given greater value and\nless willingly offered to truth for healing and for help. No illusion\nhas any truth in it. Yet it appears some are more true than others,\nalthough this clearly makes no sense at all. All that a hierarchy of\nillusions can show is preference, not reality. What relevance has\npreference to the truth? Illusions are illusions and are false. Your\npreference gives them no reality. Not one is true in any way, and all\nmust yield with equal ease to what God gave as answer to them all. God’s\nWill is One. And any wish that seems to go against His Will has <em>no</em>\nfoundation in the truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> Sin is not error, for it goes beyond correction to impossibility. Yet\nthe belief that it is real has made some errors seem forever past the\nhope of healing and the lasting grounds for hell. If this were so, would\nHeaven be opposed by its own opposite, as real as it. Then would God’s\nWill be split in two and all creation be subjected to the laws of two\nopposing powers until God becomes impatient, splits the world apart, and\nrelegates attack unto Himself. Thus has He lost His Mind, proclaiming\nsin has taken His reality from Him, and brought His love at last to\nvengeance’s heels. For such an insane picture, an insane defense can be\nexpected but can <em>not</em> establish that the picture must be true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> Nothing gives meaning where no meaning is. And truth <em>needs</em> no\ndefense to make it true. Illusions have no witnesses and no effects. Who\nlooks on them is but deceived. Forgiveness is the only function here and\nserves to bring the joy this world denies to every aspect of God’s Son\nwhere sin was thought to rule. Perhaps you do not see the role\nforgiveness plays in ending death and all beliefs that rise from mists\nof guilt.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> Sins are beliefs which you impose between your brother and yourself.\nThey limit you to time and place and give a little space to you, another\nlittle space to him. This separating off is symbolized in your\nperception by a body which is clearly separate and a thing apart. Yet\nwhat this symbol represents is but your wish to <em>be</em> apart and separate.\nForgiveness takes <em>away</em> what stands between your brother and yourself.\nIt is the wish that you be joined with him and <em>not</em> apart. We call it\n“wish” because it still conceives of other choices and has not yet\nreached beyond the world of choice entirely.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> Yet is this wish in line with Heaven’s state and not in opposition to\nGod’s Will. Although it falls far short of giving you your full\ninheritance, it <em>does</em> remove the obstacles which you have placed\nbetween the Heaven where you are and recognition of where and what you\nare. Facts are unchanged. Yet facts can be denied and thus unknown,\nthough they were known <em>before</em> they were denied.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Salvation, perfect and complete, asks but a little wish that what is\ntrue be true; a little willingness to overlook what is not there; a\nlittle sigh that speaks for Heaven as a preference to this world which\ndeath and desolation seem to rule. In joyous answer will creation rise\nwithin you to replace the world you see with Heaven, wholly perfect and\ncomplete. What is forgiveness but a willingness that truth be true? What\ncan remain unhealed and broken from a Unity Which holds all things\nwithin Itself? There <em>is</em> no sin. And every miracle is possible the\ninstant that the Son of God perceives his wishes and the Will of God are\none.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> What is the Will of God? He wills His Son have everything. And this\nHe guaranteed when He created him <em>as</em> everything. It is impossible that\nanything be lost if what you <em>have</em> is what you <em>are</em>. This is the\nmiracle by which creation became your function, sharing it with God. It\nis not understood apart from Him and therefore has no meaning in this\nworld.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> Here does the Son of God ask not too much but far too little. He\nwould sacrifice his own identity with everything to find a little\ntreasure of his own. And this he cannot do without a sense of isolation,\nloss, and loneliness. This is the treasure he has sought to find. And he\ncould only be afraid of it. Is fear a treasure? Can uncertainty be what\nyou <em>want</em>? Or is it a mistake about your will and what you <em>really</em>\nare? Let us consider what the error is, so it can be corrected, not\nprotected.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> Sin is belief attack can be projected outside the mind where the\nbelief arose. Here is the firm conviction that ideas <em>can</em> leave their\nsource made real and meaningful. And from this error does the world of\nsin and sacrifice arise. This world is an attempt to prove your\ninnocence while cherishing attack. Its failure lies in that you <em>still</em>\nfeel guilty, though without understanding <em>why</em>. Effects are seen as\nseparate from their source and seem to be beyond you to control or to\nprevent. What is thus <em>kept</em> apart can never join.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> Cause and effect are one, not separate. God wills you learn what\nalways has been true—that He created you as part of Him, and this must\nstill be true <em>because</em> ideas leave not their source. Such is creation’s\nlaw—that each idea the mind conceives but <em>adds</em> to its abundance,\n<em>never</em> takes away. This is as true of what is idly wished as what is\ntruly willed, because the mind can wish to be deceived but cannot make\nit be what it is not. And to believe ideas can leave their source is to\ninvite illusions to be true, <em>without success</em>. For never will success\nbe possible in trying to deceive the Son of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> The miracle is possible when cause and consequence are brought\ntogether, not kept separate. The healing of effect without the cause can\nmerely shift effects to other forms. And this is <em>not</em> release. God’s\nSon could never be content with less than full salvation and escape from\nguilt. For otherwise he still demands that he must make some sacrifice\nand thus denies that everything is his, unlimited by loss of any kind. A\ntiny sacrifice is just the same in its effects as is the whole idea of\nsacrifice. If loss in any form is possible, then is God’s Son made\nincomplete and not himself. [Nor will he know himself nor recognize his\nwill.] He has forsworn his Father <em>and</em> himself and made them both his\nenemies in hate.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> Illusions serve the purpose they were made to serve. And from their\npurpose, they derive whatever meaning that they seem to have. God gave\nto all illusions that were made <em>another</em> purpose that would justify a\nmiracle, whatever form they took. In every miracle all healing lies, for\nGod gave answer to them all as one. And what is one to Him must be the\nsame. If you believe what is the same is different, you but deceive\nyourself. What God calls one will be forever one, not separate. His\nKingdom <em>is</em> united—thus it was created, and thus will it ever be.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> The miracle but calls your ancient name, which you will recognize\nbecause the truth is in your memory. And to this name, your brother\ncalls for his release and yours. Heaven is shining on the Son of God.\nDeny him not, that you may be released. Each instant is the Son of God\nreborn, until he chooses not to die again. In every wish to hurt, he\nchooses death instead of what his Father wills for him. Yet every\ninstant offers life to him because his Father wills that he should live.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> In crucifixion is redemption laid, for healing is not needed where\nthere is no pain or suffering. Forgiveness is the answer to attack of\nany kind. So is attack deprived of its effects, and hate is answered in\nthe name of love. To you to whom it has been given to save the Son of\nGod from crucifixion and from hell and death, all glory be forever. For\nyou have power to save the Son of God because his Father willed that it\nbe so. And in your hands does all salvation lie, to be both offered and\nreceived as one.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> To use the power God has given you as He would have it used is\nnatural. It is not arrogant to be as He created you or to make use of\nwhat He gave to answer all His Son’s mistakes and set him free. But it\n<em>is</em> arrogant to lay aside the power that He gave and choose a little\nsenseless wish instead of what He wills. The gift of God to you <em>is</em>\nlimitless. There is no circumstance it cannot answer and no problem\nwhich is not resolved within its gracious light.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> Abide in peace, where God would have you be, and be the means whereby\nyour brother finds the peace in which your wishes are fulfilled. Let us\nunite in bringing blessing to the world of sin and death. For what can\nsave each one of us can save us all. There is no difference among the\nSons of God. The unity that specialness denies will save them all, for\nwhat is one can have no specialness. And everything belongs to each of\nthem. No wishes lie between a brother and his own. To get from one is to\ndeprive them all. And yet to bless but one gives blessing to them all as\none.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> Your ancient name belongs to everyone, as theirs to you. Call on your\nbrother’s name and God will answer, for on Him you call. Could He refuse\nto answer when He has <em>already</em> answered all who call on Him? A miracle\ncan make no change at all. But it <em>can</em> make what always has been true\nbe recognized by those who know it not. And by this little gift of truth\nbut let to be itself—the Son of God allowed to be himself and all\ncreation freed to call upon the Name of God as one.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>68</sup> The one remaining problem that you have is that you see an interval\nbetween the time when you forgive and will receive the benefits of\ntrust. This but reflects the little you would keep between yourselves\nthat you might be a little separate. For time and space are one illusion\nwhich takes different forms. If it has been projected beyond your minds,\nyou think of it as time. The nearer it is brought to where it is, the\nmore you think of it in terms of space.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> There is a distance you would keep apart from one another, and this\nspace you see as time because you still believe you are external to each\nother. This makes trust impossible. And you cannot believe that trust\nwould settle every problem <em>now</em>. Thus do you think it safer to remain a\nlittle careful and a little watchful of interests perceived as separate.\nFrom this perception you cannot conceive of gaining what forgiveness\noffers <em>now</em>. The interval you think lies in between the giving and\nreceiving of the gift seems to be one in which you sacrifice and suffer\nloss. You see eventual salvation, not immediate results.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> Salvation <em>is</em> immediate. Unless you so perceive it, you will be\nafraid of it, believing that the risk of loss is great between the time\nits purpose is made yours and its effects will come to you. In this form\nis the error still obscured that is the source of fear. Salvation\n<em>would</em> wipe out the space you see between you still and let you\ninstantly become as one. And it is <em>here</em> you fear the loss would lie.\nDo not project this fear to time, for time is not the enemy that you\nperceive. Time is as neutral as the body is except in terms of what you\nsee it <em>for</em>. If you would keep a little space between you still, you\nwant a little time in which forgiveness is withheld a little while. This\nmakes the interval between the time in which forgiveness is withheld and\ngiven seem dangerous, with terror justified.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> Yet space between you is apparent <em>now</em> and cannot be perceived in\nfuture time. No more can it be overlooked except within the present.\nFuture loss is not your fear. But present <em>joining</em> is your dread. Who\ncan feel desolation except <em>now</em>? A future cause as yet has no effects.\nAnd therefore must it be that if you fear, there is a <em>present</em> cause.\nAnd it is <em>this</em> that needs correction, not a future state.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> The plans you make for safety all are laid within the future, where\nyou <em>cannot</em> plan. No purpose has been given it as yet, and what will\nhappen has as yet no cause. Who can predict effects without a cause? And\nwho could fear effects unless he thought they <em>had</em> been caused and\njudged disastrous <em>now</em>? Belief in sin arouses fear and, like its cause,\nis looking forward, looking back but <em>overlooking</em> what is here and now.\nYet only here and now its cause must be if its effects already have been\njudged as fearful. And in overlooking this, is it protected and kept\nseparate from healing. For a miracle is <em>now</em>. It stands already here in\npresent grace, within the only interval of time which sin and fear have\noverlooked but which is all there <em>is</em> to time. The working out of all\ncorrection takes no time at all.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> Yet the <em>acceptance</em> of the working out can seem to take forever. The\nchange of purpose the Holy Spirit brought to your relationship has in it\nall effects that you will see. They can be looked at <em>now</em>. Why wait\ntill they unfold in time and fear they may not come, although already\nthere? You have been told that everything brings good that comes from\nGod. And yet it seems as if this is not so. Good in disaster’s form is\ndifficult to credit in advance. Nor is there really sense in this idea.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> Why should the good appear in evil’s form? And is it not deception if\nit does? Its cause is here if it appears at all. Why are not its effects\napparent then? Why in the future? And you seek to be content with\nsighing and with “reasoning” you do not understand it now but will some\nday. And then its meaning will be clear. This is not reason, for it is\nunjust and clearly hints at punishment until the time of liberation is\nat hand. Given a change of purpose for the good, there is no reason for\nan interval in which disaster strikes, to be perceived as “good” some\nday but now in form of pain. This is a sacrifice of <em>now</em>, which could\nnot be the cost the Holy Spirit asks for what He gave without a cost at\nall.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> Yet this illusion has a cause which, though untrue, must be already\nin your mind. And this illusion is but one effect which it engenders and\none form in which its outcome is perceived. This interval in time, when\nretribution is perceived to be the form in which the “good” appears, is\nbut one aspect of the little space that lies between you, unforgiven\nstill.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> Be not content with future happiness. It has no meaning and is <em>not</em>\nyour just reward. For you have cause for freedom <em>now.</em> What profits\nfreedom in a prisoner’s form? Why should deliverance be disguised as\ndeath? Delay is senseless, and the “reasoning” which would maintain\neffects of present cause must be delayed until a future time is merely a\ndenial of the fact that consequence and cause must come as one. Look not\nto time but to the little space between you still to be delivered from.\nAnd do not let it be disguised as time and so preserved because its form\nis changed and what it <em>is</em> cannot be recognized. The Holy Spirit’s\npurpose <em>now</em> is yours. Should not His happiness be yours as well?</p>\n\n",

What has been locked is\nopened; what was held apart from light is given up, that light may shine\non it, and leave no space nor distance lingering between the light of\nHeaven and the world.</p>\n\n<p><sup>82</sup> The holiest of all the spots on earth is where an ancient hatred has\nbecome a present love. And They come quickly to the living temple, where\na home for Them has been set up. There is no place in Heaven holier. And\nThey have come to dwell within the temple offered them, to be Their\nresting-place as well as yours. What hatred has released to love becomes\nthe brightest light in Heaven’s radiance. And all the lights in Heaven\nbrighter grow, in gratitude for what has been restored.</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> Around you angels hover lovingly, to keep away all darkened thoughts\nof sin and keep the light where it has entered in.

    "content": "<p><sup>85</sup> What then remains to be undone for you to realize Their Presence?\nOnly this—you have a differential view of when attack is justified and\nwhen you think it is unfair and not to be allowed. When you perceive it\nas unfair, you think that a response of anger now is just. And thus you\nsee what is the same as different. Confusion is not limited. If it\noccurs at all, it will be total. And its presence, in whatever form,\nwill hide Their Presence. They are known with clarity or not at all.\nConfused perception will block knowledge. It is not a question of the\nsize of the confusion or how much it interferes. Its simple presence\nshuts the door to Theirs and keeps Them there unknown.</p>\n\n<p><sup>86</sup> What does it mean if you perceive attack in certain forms to be\nunfair to you? It means that there must be some forms in which you think\nit <em>fair</em>. For otherwise, how could some be evaluated as unfair? Some\nthen are given meaning and perceived as sensible. And only some are seen\nas meaningless. And this denies the fact that <em>all</em> are\nsenseless—equally without a cause or consequence and cannot have effects\nof <em>any</em> kind. Their Presence is obscured by any veil which stands\nbetween Their shining innocence and your awareness it is your own and\n<em>equally</em> belongs to every living thing along with you. God limits not.\nAnd what is limited can <em>not</em> be Heaven. So it <em>must</em> be hell.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> Unfairness and attack are <em>one</em> mistake, so firmly joined that where\none is perceived, the other must be seen. You cannot <em>be</em> unfairly\ntreated. The belief you are is but another form of the idea you are\ndeprived by someone not yourself. Projection of the cause of sacrifice\nis at the root of everything perceived to be unfair and not your just\ndeserts. Yet it is <em>you</em> who ask this of yourself in deep injustice to\nthe Son of God. You have no enemy except yourself, and you are enemy\nindeed to him because you do not know him <em>as</em> yourself. What could be\nmore unjust than that he be deprived of what he <em>is</em>, denied the right\nto be himself, and asked to sacrifice his Father’s love and yours as not\nhis due?</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> Beware of the temptation to perceive yourself unfairly treated. In\nthis view, you seek to find an innocence which is not Theirs but yours\nalone and at the cost of someone else’s guilt. Can innocence be\npurchased by the giving of your guilt to someone else? And <em>is</em> this\ninnocence which your attack on him attempts to get? Is it not\nretribution for your own attack upon the Son of God you seek? Is it not\nsafer to believe that you are innocent of this and victimized despite\nyour innocence? Whatever way the game of guilt is played, there <em>must</em>\nbe loss. Someone must lose his innocence that someone else can take it\nfrom him, making it his own.</p>\n\n<p><sup>89</sup> You think your brother is unfair to you because you think that one\nmust be unfair to make the other innocent. And in this game do you\nperceive one purpose for your whole relationship. And this you seek to\nadd unto the purpose given it. The Holy Spirit’s purpose is to let the\nPresence of your holy Guests be known to you. And to this purpose,\nnothing <em>can</em> be added, for the world is purposeless except for this. To\nadd or take away from this <em>one</em> goal is but to take away all purpose\nfrom the world and from yourself. And each unfairness that the world\nappears to lay upon you, <em>you</em> have laid on <em>it</em> by rendering it\npurposeless, without the function that the Holy Spirit sees. And simple\njustice has been thus denied to every living thing upon the earth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>90</sup> What this injustice does to you who judge unfairly and who see as you\nhave judged, you cannot calculate. The world grows dim and threatening,\nand not a trace of all the happy sparkle that salvation brought can you\nperceive to lighten up your way. And so you see yourself deprived of\nlight, abandoned to the dark, unfairly left without a purpose in a\nfutile world. The world is fair because the Holy Spirit has brought\ninjustice to the light within, and there has all unfairness been\nresolved and been replaced with justice and with love. If you perceive\ninjustice anywhere, you need but say:</p>\n\n<p><sup>91</sup> <em>By this do I deny the Presence of the Father and the Son.<br />\nAnd I would rather know of Them than see injustice,<br />\nwhich Their Presence shines away.</em></p>\n\n",

You hold a picture of your crucifixion before his eyes that he may\nsee his sins are writ in Heaven in your blood and death and go before\nhim, closing off the gate and damning him to hell. Yet this is writ in\nhell and not in Heaven, where you are beyond attack and prove his\n<em>innocence</em>. The picture of yourself you offer him you show <em>yourself</em>\nand give it all your faith. The Holy Spirit offers you to give to him a\npicture of yourself in which there is no pain and no reproach at all.\nAnd what was martyred to his guilt becomes the perfect witness to his\ninnocence.</p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup> The power of witness is beyond belief because it brings conviction in\nits wake. The witness is believed because he points beyond himself to\nwhat he represents. A sick and suffering you but represents your\nbrother’s guilt—the witness which you send lest he forget the injuries\nhe gave from which you swear he never will escape. This sick and sorry\npicture <em>you</em> accept, if only it can serve to punish him. The sick are\nmerciless to everyone, and in contagion do they seek to kill. Death\nseems an easy price if they can say, “Behold me, brother; at your hand I\ndie.” For sickness is the witness to his guilt, and death would prove\nhis errors must be sins.</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> Sickness is but a “little” death; a form of vengeance not yet total.\nYet it speaks with certainty for what it represents. The bleak and\nbitter picture you have sent your brother <em>you</em> have looked upon in\ngrief. And everything that it has shown to him have you believed because\nit witnessed to the guilt in him which you perceived and loved. Now in\nthe hands made gentle by His touch, the Holy Spirit lays a picture of a\ndifferent you. It is a picture of a body still, for what you <em>really</em>\nare cannot be seen nor pictured. Yet this one has not been used for\npurpose of attack and therefore never suffered pain at all. It witnesses\nto the eternal truth that you cannot <em>be</em> hurt and points beyond itself\nto both your innocence and his.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> Show <em>this</em> unto your brother, who will see that every scar is healed\nand every tear is wiped away in laughter and in love. And he will look\non his forgiveness there and with healed eyes will look beyond it to the\ninnocence that he beholds in you. Here is the proof that he has never\nsinned—that nothing which his madness bid him do was ever done or ever\nhad effects of any kind; that no reproach he laid upon his heart was\never justified, and no attack can ever touch him with the poisoned and\nrelentless sting of fear. Attest his innocence and <em>not</em> his guilt.\n<em>Your</em> healing is his comfort and his health because it <em>proves</em>\nillusions are not true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> It is not will for life, but wish for death that is the motivation for\nthis world. Its only purpose is to prove guilt real. No worldly thought\nor act or feeling has a motivation other than this one. These are the\nwitnesses that are called forth to be believed and lend conviction to\nthe system they speak for and represent. And each has many voices,\nspeaking to your brother and yourself in different tongues. And yet to\nboth the message is the same. Adornment of the body seeks to show how\nlovely are the witnesses for guilt. Concerns about the body demonstrate\nhow frail and vulnerable is your life, how easily destroyed is what you\nlove. Depression speaks of death and vanity of real concern with\nanything at all. The strongest witness to futility, which bolsters all\nthe rest and helps them paint the picture in which sin is justified, is\nsickness in whatever form it takes.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> The sick have reason for each one of their unnatural desires and\nstrange needs. For who could live a life so soon cut short and not\nesteem the worth of passing joys? What pleasures could there be that\nwill endure? Are not the frail entitled to believe that every stolen\nscrap of pleasure is their righteous payment for their little lives?\nTheir death will pay the price for all of them if they enjoy their\nbenefits or not. The end of life must come, whatever way that life be\nspent. And so take pleasure in the quickly passing and ephemeral.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> These are not sins, but witnesses unto the strange belief that sin and\ndeath are real, and innocence and sin will end alike within the\ntermination of the grave. If this were true, there <em>would</em> be reason to\nremain content to seek for passing joys and cherish little pleasures\nwhere you can. Yet in this picture is the body not perceived as neutral\nand without a goal inherent in itself. For it becomes the symbol of\nreproach, the sign of guilt whose consequences still are there to see,\nso that the cause can never be denied.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> Your function is to [prove to] your brother that sin can <em>have</em> no\ncause. How futile must it be to see yourself a picture of the proof that\nwhat your function is can never be! The Holy Spirit’s picture changes\nnot the body into something it is not. It only takes away from it all\nsigns of accusation and of blamefulness. Pictured without a purpose, it\nis seen as neither sick nor well, nor bad nor good. No grounds are\noffered that it may be judged in any way at all. It has no life, but\nneither is it dead. It stands apart from all experience of fear or love.\nFor now it witnesses to nothing yet, its purpose being open and the mind\nmade free again to choose what it is <em>for</em>. Now is it not condemned, but\nwaiting for a purpose to be given that it may fulfill the function that\nit will receive.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> Into this empty space, from which the goal of sin has been removed,\nis Heaven free to be remembered. Here its peace can come and perfect\nhealing take the place of death. The body can become a sign of life, a\npromise of redemption, and a breath of immortality to those grown sick\nof breathing in the fetid scent of death. Let it have healing as its\npurpose. Then will it send forth the message it received and by its\nhealth and loveliness proclaim the truth and value that it represents.\nLet it receive the power to represent an endless life, forever\nunattacked. And to your brother let its message be, “Behold me, brother;\nat your hand I live.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> The simple way to let this be achieved is merely this—to let the body\nhave no purpose from the past, when you were sure you knew its purpose\nwas to foster guilt. For this insists your crippled picture is a lasting\nsign of what it represents. This leaves no space in which a different\nview, another purpose, can be given it. You do <em>not</em> know its purpose.\nYou but gave <em>illusions</em> of a purpose to a thing you made to hide your\nfunction from yourself. This thing without a purpose cannot hide the\nfunction that the Holy Spirit gave. Let, then, its purpose and your\nfunction both be reconciled at last and seen as one.</p>\n\n",

Who has been injured by his\nbrother and could love and trust him still? He has attacked and will\nattack again. Protect him not, because your damaged body shows that you\nmust be protected from him. To forgive may be an act of charity, but not\nhis due. He may be pitied for his guilt, but not exonerated. And if you\nforgive him his transgressions, you but add to all the guilt that he has\nreally earned.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> The unhealed <em>cannot</em> pardon. For they are the witnesses that pardon\nis unfair. They would retain the consequences of the guilt they\noverlook. Yet no one can forgive a sin which he believes is real.

Good cannot <em>be</em> returned for evil, for forgiveness\ndoes not first establish sin and <em>then</em> forgive it.

They cannot forgive their\nbrothers and themselves as well. For no one in whom true forgiveness\nreigns can suffer. He holds not the proof of sin before his brother’s\neyes. And thus he must have overlooked it and removed it from his own.\nForgiveness cannot be for one and not the other. Who forgives <em>is</em>\nhealed. And in his healing lies the proof that he has truly pardoned and\nretains no trace of condemnation that he still would hold against\nhimself or any living thing.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> Forgiveness is not real <em>unless</em> it brings a healing to your brother\n<em>and</em> yourself. You must attest his sins had no effect on you to\ndemonstrate they were not real. How else could he be guiltless? And how\ncould his innocence be justified unless his sins have no effect to\nwarrant guilt? Sins are beyond forgiveness just because they would\nentail effects which cannot be undone and overlooked entirely. In their\nundoing lies the proof that they were merely errors. <em>Let</em> yourself be\nhealed that you may be forgiving, offering salvation to your brother and\nyourself. A broken body shows the mind has not been healed. A miracle of\nhealing proves that separation is without effect. What you would prove\nto him, you will believe. The power of witness <em>comes</em> from your belief.\nAnd everything you say or do or think but testifies to what you teach to\nhim.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> Your body can be means to teach that it has never suffered pain\nbecause of him. And in its healing can it offer him mute testimony of\nhis innocence. It is this testimony which can speak with power greater\nthan a thousand tongues. For here is his forgiveness <em>proved</em> to him. A\nmiracle can offer nothing less to him than it has given unto you. So\ndoes your healing show your mind is healed and has forgiven what he did\nnot do. And so is he convinced his innocence was never lost and healed\nalong with you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> Thus does the miracle undo all things the world attests can never\n<em>be</em> undone. And hopelessness and death must disappear before the\nancient clarion call of life. This call has power far beyond the weak\nand miserable cry of death and guilt. The ancient calling of the Father\nto His Son, and of the Son unto his own, will yet be the last trumpet\nthat the world will ever hear. Brother, there <em>is</em> no death. And this\nyou learn when you but wish to show your brother that you had no hurt of\nhim. He thinks your blood is on his hands, and so he stands condemned.\nYet it is given you to show him by your healing that his guilt is but\nthe fabric of a senseless dream.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> How just are miracles! For they bestow an equal gift of full\ndeliverance from guilt upon your brother and yourself. Your healing\nsaves him pain as well as you, and you are healed because you wished him\nwell. This is the law the miracle obeys; that healing sees no\nspecialness at all. It does not come from pity but from love. And love\nwould prove all suffering is but a vain imagining, a foolish wish with\nno effects. Your health is a result of your desire to see your brother\nwith no blood upon his hands nor guilt upon his heart made heavy with\nthe proof of sin. And what you wish <em>is</em> given you to see.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> The “cost” of your serenity is his. This is the “price” the Holy\nSpirit and the world interpret differently. The world perceives it as a\nstatement of the “fact” that your salvation <em>sacrifices</em> his. The Holy\nSpirit <em>knows</em> your healing is the witness unto his and cannot be apart\nfrom his at all. As long as he consents to suffer, you will be unhealed.\nYet you can show him that his suffering is purposeless and wholly\nwithout cause. Show him your healing, and he will consent no more to\nsuffer. For his innocence has been established in your sight and his.\nAnd laughter will replace your sighs because God’s Son remembered that\nhe <em>is</em> God’s Son.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> Who then fears healing? Only those to whom their brother’s sacrifice\nand pain are seen to represent their own serenity. Their helplessness\nand weakness represent the grounds on which they <em>justify</em> his pain. The\nconstant sting of guilt he suffers serves to prove that he is slave but\nthey are free. The constant pain they suffer demonstrates that they are\nfree <em>because</em> they hold him bound. And sickness is desired to prevent a\nshift of balance in the sacrifice. How could the Holy Spirit be deterred\nan instant, even less, to reason with an argument for sickness such as\nthis? And need your healing be delayed because you pause to listen to\ninsanity?</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> [Correction is <em>not</em> your function. It belongs to One Who knows of\nfairness, <em>not</em> of guilt. If you assume correction’s role, you <em>lose</em>\nthe function of forgiveness. No one can forgive until he learns\ncorrection is <em>but</em> to forgive and <em>never</em> to accuse. Alone, you\n<em>cannot</em> see they are the same, and therefore is correction <em>not</em> of\nyou. Identity and function are the same, and <em>by</em> your function do you\nknow yourself. And thus, if you confuse your function with the function\nof Another, you <em>must</em> be confused about yourself and who you are. What\nis the separation but a wish to take God’s function from Him and <em>deny</em>\nthat it is His? Yet if it is <em>not</em> His, it is not <em>yours</em>, for <em>you</em>\nmust lose what you would take away.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> [In a split mind, identity <em>must</em> seem to be divided. Nor can anyone\nperceive a function unified which has conflicting purposes and different\nends. Correction, to a mind so split, <em>must</em> be a way to punish sins you\nthink are <em>yours</em> in someone else. And thus does he become your victim,\n<em>not</em> your brother, <em>different</em> from you in that he is <em>more guilty</em>,\nthus in need of your correction as the one <em>more innocent</em> than he. This\nsplits <em>his</em> function off from yours and gives you both a <em>different</em>\nrole. And so you <em>cannot</em> be perceived as one and, with a single\nfunction, that would <em>mean</em> a shared identity with but <em>one</em> end.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> [Correction <em>you</em> would do <em>must</em> separate, because that is the\nfunction given it <em>by</em> you. When you perceive correction is the <em>same</em>\nas pardon, then you also know the Holy Spirit’s mind and yours are one.\nAnd so your <em>own</em> Identity is found. Yet must He work with what is\n<em>given</em> Him, and you allow Him only <em>half</em> your mind. And thus He\nrepresents the <em>other</em> half and seems to have a <em>different</em> purpose from\nthe one you cherish and you <em>think</em> is yours. Thus does your function\nseem <em>divided</em>, with a half <em>in opposition</em> to a half. And these two\nhalves appear to represent a split within a self perceived as two.]</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> Consider how this self perception must extend, and do not overlook\nthe fact that every thought extends because that is its purpose, being\nwhat it really <em>is</em>. From an idea of self as two, there comes a\nnecessary view of function split between the two. And what you would\ncorrect is only half the error, which you think is all of it. Your\nbrother’s sins become the central target for correction, lest your\nerrors and his own be seen as one. Yours are mistakes, but his are sins\nand not the same as yours. His merit punishment, while yours in fairness\nshould be overlooked.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> In this interpretation of correction, your own mistakes you will not\neven see. The focus of correction has been placed outside yourself on\none who cannot be a part of you while this perception lasts. What is\ncondemned can never be returned to its accuser, who hated it and hates\nit still. This is your brother, focus of your hate, unworthy to be part\nof you and thus outside yourself—the other half which is denied. And\nonly what is left without his presence is perceived as all of you. To\nthis remaining half the Holy Spirit must represent the other half until\nyou recognize it <em>is</em> the other half. And this He does by giving both of\nyou a function that is one, not different.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> Correction is the function given <em>both</em>, but neither one alone. And\nwhen it is fulfilled as <em>shared</em>, it <em>must</em> correct mistakes in both of\nyou. It cannot leave mistakes in one unhealed and set the other free.\nThat is divided purpose which cannot be shared, and so it cannot be the\nfunction which the Holy Spirit sees as His. And you can rest assured\nthat He will not fulfill a function He cannot understand and recognize\nas His. For only thus can He keep yours preserved intact, despite your\nseparate views of what your function is. If He upheld divided function,\nyou were lost indeed. His inability to see His goal divided and distinct\nfor each of you preserves your Self from being made aware of any\nfunction other than Its own. And thus is healing given both of you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> Correction must be left to One Who knows correction and forgiveness\nare the same. With half a mind, this is not understood. Leave then\ncorrection to the mind that <em>is</em> united, functioning as one because It\nis not split in purpose and conceives a single function as Its <em>only</em>\none. Here is the function given It conceived to be Its own and not apart\nfrom that Its Giver keeps <em>because</em> it has been shared. In His\nacceptance of this function lies the means whereby your mind is unified.\nHis single purpose unifies the halves of you which you perceive as\nseparate. And each forgives the other, that he may accept his other half\nas part of him.</p>",

Weak strength is meaningless, and\npower used to weaken is employed to limit. And therefore it must be\nlimited and weak because that is its purpose. Power is unopposed, to be\nitself. No weakness can intrude on it without changing it into something\nit is not. To weaken is to limit and impose an opposite that contradicts\nthe concept which it attacks. And by this does it join to the idea a\nsomething it is not and make it unintelligible. Who can understand a\ndouble concept, such as “weakened-power” or as “hateful-love?”</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> You have decided that your brother is a symbol for a “hateful-love,”\na “weakened-power,” and above all, a “living-death.” And so he has no\nmeaning to you, for he stands for what is meaningless. He represents a\ndouble thought, where half is canceled out by the remaining half. Yet\neven this is quickly contradicted by the half it canceled out, and so\nthey both are gone. And now he stands for nothing. Symbols which but\nrepresent ideas that cannot be must stand for empty space and\nnothingness. Yet nothingness and empty space can <em>not</em> be interference.\nWhat <em>can</em> interfere with the awareness of reality is the belief that\nthere is something <em>there</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> The picture of your brother that you see means nothing. There is\nnothing to attack or to deny, love, or hate, or to endow with power or\nto see as weak. The picture has been wholly canceled out because it\nsymbolized a contradiction which canceled out the <em>thought</em> it\nrepresents. And thus the picture has no cause at all. Who can perceive\neffect without a cause? What can the causeless be but nothingness? The\npicture of your brother that you see is wholly absent and has never\nbeen. Let then the empty space it occupies be <em>recognized</em> as vacant,\nand the time devoted to its seeing be perceived as idly spent, a time\nunoccupied.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> An empty space which is not seen as filled, an unused interval of\ntime not seen as spent and fully occupied, becomes a silent invitation\nto the truth to enter and to make itself at home. No preparation can be\nmade that would enhance the invitation’s real appeal. For what you leave\nas vacant, God will fill, and where He is, there <em>must</em> the truth abide.\nUnweakened power with no opposite is what creation <em>is.</em> For this there\n<em>are</em> no symbols. Nothing points beyond the truth, for what can stand\nfor more than everything? Yet true undoing must be kind. And so the\nfirst replacement for your picture is another picture of another kind.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> As nothingness cannot be pictured, so there is no symbol for\ntotality. Reality is ultimately known without a form, unpictured and\nunseen. Forgiveness is not yet a power known as wholly free of limits.\nYet it sets no limits you have chosen to impose. Forgiveness is the\nmeans by which the truth is represented temporarily. It lets the Holy\nSpirit make exchange of pictures possible until the time when aids are\nmeaningless and learning done. No learning aid has use which can extend\nbeyond the goal of learning. When its aim has been accomplished, it is\nfunctionless. Yet in the learning interval it has a use which now you\nfear, but yet will love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> The picture of your brother given you to occupy the space so lately\nleft unoccupied and vacant will not need defense of any kind. For you\nwill give it overwhelming preference. Nor delay an instant in deciding\nthat it is the only one you want. It does not stand for double concepts.\nThough it is but half the picture and is incomplete, within itself it is\nthe same. The other half of what it represents remains unknown but is\nnot canceled out. And thus is God left free to take the final step\nHimself. [For this you need <em>no</em> pictures and <em>no</em> learning aids.] And\nwhat will ultimately take the place of every learning aid will merely\n<em>be</em>. Forgiveness vanishes and symbols fade, and nothing which the eyes\nhave ever seen or ears have heard remains to be perceived.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> A Power wholly limitless has come, not to destroy, but to receive Its\nown. There is no choice of function anywhere. The choice you fear to\nlose you never had. Yet only this appears to interfere with power\nunlimited and single thoughts, complete and happy, without opposite. You\ndo not know the peace of power which opposes nothing. Yet no other kind\ncan be at all. Give welcome to the Power beyond forgiveness and beyond\nthe world of symbols and of limitations. He would merely <em>be</em>, and so He\nmerely <em>is.</em></p>\n\n",

It is this: “Of these illusions,\nwhich of them are true? Which ones establish peace and offer joy?

What can the body get that you would want the most of all?\nIt is your servant and your friend. But tell it what you want, and it\nwill serve you lovingly and well.” And this is not a question, for it\ntells you what you want and where to go for it. It leaves no room to\nquestion its beliefs, except that what it states takes question’s\n<em>form</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> A pseudo-question has no answer. It <em>dictates</em> the answer even as it\nasks. Thus is all questioning within the world a form of propaganda for\nitself.

Where answers represent the questions, they add\nnothing new, and nothing has been learned.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> An honest question is a learning tool which asks for something that\nyou do <em>not</em> know. It does not set conditions for response, but merely\nasks what the response should be.

And it is born the instant it\nis offered and <em>received</em>. No one can ask another to be healed. But he\ncan let <em>himself</em> be healed and thus offer the other what he has\nreceived. Who can bestow upon another what he does not have? And who can\nshare what he denies himself? The Holy Spirit speaks to <em>you</em>. He does\nnot speak to someone else. Yet by your listening, His Voice extends\nbecause you have <em>accepted</em> what He says.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> Health is the witness unto health. As long as it is unattested, it\nremains without conviction. Only when demonstrated has it been proved\nand <em>must</em> compel belief. No one is healed through double messages. If\nyou wish only to be healed, you heal. Your <em>single</em> purpose makes this\npossible. But if you are afraid of healing, then it cannot come through\nyou. The only thing that is required for a healing is a lack of fear.\nThe fearful are not healed and cannot heal. This does not mean the\nconflict must be gone forever from your mind. For if it were, there’d be\nno need for healing then. But it <em>does</em> mean, if only for an instant,\nyou love without attack. An instant is sufficient. Miracles wait not on\ntime.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> The holy instant is the miracle’s abiding-place. From there each one\nis born into this world as witness to a state of mind which has\ntranscended conflict and has reached to peace. It carries comfort from\nthe place of peace into the battleground and demonstrates that war has\nno effects. For all the hurt that war has sought to bring, the broken\nbodies, and the shattered limbs, the screaming dying and the silent\ndead, are gently lifted up and comforted. There <em>is</em> no sadness where a\nmiracle has come to heal. And nothing more than just <em>one</em> instant of\nyour love without attack is necessary that all this occur. In that one\ninstant are you healed, and in that single instant is all healing done.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> What stands apart from you when you accept the blessing that the holy\ninstant brings? Be not afraid of blessing, for the One Who blesses you\nloves all the world and leaves nothing within the world that could be\nfeared. But if you shrink from blessing will the world indeed seem\nfearful, for you have withheld its peace and comfort, leaving it to die.\nWould not a world so bitterly bereft be looked on as a condemnation by\nthe one who could have saved it but stepped back because he was afraid\nof being healed? The eyes of all the dying bring reproach, and suffering\nwhispers, “What is there to fear?” Consider well its question. It is\nasked of you on your behalf. A dying world asks only that you rest an\ninstant from attack upon yourself, that it be healed.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> Come to the holy instant and be healed, for nothing that is there\nreceived is left behind on your returning to the world.

The holy instant’s radiance will light your eyes\nand give them sight to see beyond all suffering and see Christ’s face\ninstead. Healing <em>replaces</em> suffering. Who looks on one cannot perceive\nthe other, for they cannot both be there. And what you see the world\nwill witness, and will witness <em>to</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> Thus is your healing everything the world requires that it may be\nhealed. It needs <em>one</em> lesson which has perfectly been learned. And then\nwhen you forget it will the world remind you gently of what you have\ntaught. No reinforcement will its thanks withhold from you who let\nyourself be healed that it might live. It will call forth its witnesses\nto show the face of Christ to you who brought the sight to them by which\nthey witnessed it. The world of accusation is replaced by one in which\nall eyes look lovingly upon the Friend who brought them their release.\nAnd happily your brother will perceive the many friends he thought were\nenemies.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> Problems are not specific, but they take specific forms, and these\nspecific shapes make up the world. And no one understands the nature of\nhis problem. If he did, it would be there no more for him to see. Its\nvery nature is that it is <em>not</em>. And thus while he perceives it, he can\n<em>not</em> perceive it as it is. But healing is apparent in specific\ninstances and generalizes to include them all. This is because they\nreally are the same despite their different forms. All learning aims at\ntransfer, which becomes complete within two situations which are seen as\none, for <em>only</em> common elements are there. Yet this can only be attained\nby One Who does not see the differences you see. The total transfer of\nyour learning is not made by you. But that it has been made in spite of\nall the differences you see convinces you that they could not be real.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> Your healing will extend and will be brought to problems that you\nthought were not your own. And it will also be apparent that your many\ndifferent problems will be solved as any one of them has been escaped.\nIt cannot be their differences which made this possible, for learning\ndoes not jump from situations to their opposites and bring the same\nresults. All healing must proceed in lawful manner in accord with laws\nwhich have been properly perceived but never violated. Fear you not the\nway that you perceive them. You are wrong, but there is One within you\nWho is <em>right</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> Leave, then, the transfer of your learning to the One Who really\nunderstands its laws and Who will guarantee that they remain unviolated\nand unlimited. Your part is merely to apply what He has taught you to\n<em>yourself</em>, and He will do the rest. And thus the power of your learning\nwill be proved to you by all the many different witnesses it finds. Your\nbrother first among them will be seen, but thousands stand behind him,\nand beyond each one there are a thousand more. Each one may seem to have\na problem which is different from the rest. Yet they are solved\ntogether. And their common answer shows the questions could not have\nbeen separate.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> Peace be to you to whom is healing offered. And you will learn that\npeace is given you when you accept the healing for yourself. Its total\nvalue need not be appraised by you to let you understand that you have\nbenefited from it. What occurred within the instant which love entered\nin without attack will stay with you forever. Your healing will be one\nof its effects, as will your brother’s. Everywhere you go will you\nbehold its multiplied effects. Yet all the witnesses that you behold\nwill be far less than all there really are. Infinity cannot be\nunderstood by merely counting up its separate parts.

For either\nwitness is the same and carries but one message: “You are here within\nthis body, and you can be hurt. You can have pleasure, too, but only at\nthe cost of pain.” These witnesses are joined by many more.

And for each witness to the body’s death He sends a witness to\nyour life in Him Who knows no death. Each miracle He brings is witness\nthat the body is not real. Its pains and pleasures does He heal alike,\nfor <em>all</em> sin’s witnesses do His replace.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> The miracle makes no distinctions in the names by which sin’s\nwitnesses are called. It merely proves that what they represent has no\neffects. And this it proves because its own effects have come to take\ntheir place. It matters not the name by which you called your suffering.\nIt is no longer there. The One Who brings the miracle perceived them all\nas one and called by name of fear. As fear is witness unto death, so is\nthe miracle the witness unto life. It is a witness no one can deny, for\nit is the <em>effects</em> of life it brings. The dying live, the dead arise,\nand pain has vanished. Yet a miracle speaks not but for itself, but what\nit represents.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> Love, too, has symbols in a world of sin. The miracle forgives\nbecause it stands for what is past forgiveness and is true. How foolish\nand insane it is to think a miracle is bound by laws which it came\nsolely to undo! The laws of sin have different witnesses with different\nstrengths. And they attest to different sufferings. Yet to the One Who\nsends forth miracles to bless the world, a tiny stab of pain, a little\nworldly pleasure, and the throes of death itself are but a single\nsound—a call for healing and a plaintive cry for help within a world of\nmisery. It is their <em>sameness</em> that the miracle attests. It is their\nsameness that it <em>proves</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> The laws which call them different are dissolved and <em>shown</em> as\npowerless. The purpose of a miracle is to accomplish this. And God\nHimself has guaranteed the strength of miracles for what they witness\nto. Be witnesses unto the miracle and not the laws of sin. There is no\nneed to suffer any more. But there <em>is</em> need that you be healed, because\nthe suffering of the world has made it deaf to its salvation and\ndeliverance.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> The resurrection of the world awaits your healing and your happiness,\nthat you may demonstrate the healing of the world. The holy instant will\nreplace all sin if you but carry its effects with you. And no one will\nelect to suffer more. What better function could you serve than this? Be\nhealed that you may heal, and suffer not the laws of sin to be applied\nto you. And truth will be revealed to you who chose to let love’s\nsymbols take the place of sin.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>62</sup> Suffering is an emphasis upon all that the world has done to injure\nyou. Here is the world’s demented version of salvation clearly shown.\nLike to a dream of punishment in which the dreamer is unconscious of\nwhat brought on the attack against himself, he sees himself attacked\nunjustly and by something not himself. He is the victim of this\n“something else,” a thing outside himself for which he has no reason to\nbe held responsible. He must be innocent because he knows not what he\ndoes, but what is done to him. Yet is his own attack upon himself\napparent still, for it is he who bears the suffering. And he cannot\nescape because its source is seen outside himself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> Now you are being shown you <em>can</em> escape. All that is needed is you\nlook upon the problem as it <em>is</em>, and not the way that you have set it\nup. How could there be another way to solve a problem which is very\nsimple but has been obscured by heavy clouds of complication which were\nmade to <em>keep</em> the problem unresolved? Without the clouds, the problem\nwill emerge in all its primitive simplicity. The choice will not be\ndifficult, because the problem is absurd when clearly seen. No one has\ndifficulty making up his mind to let a simple problem be resolved if it\nis <em>seen</em> as hurting him and also very easily removed.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> The “reasoning” by which the world is made, on which it rests, by\nwhich it is maintained, is simply this: “<em>You</em> are the cause of what I\ndo. Your presence <em>justifies</em> my wrath, and you exist and think <em>apart</em>\nfrom me. While you attack, I must be innocent. And what I suffer from\n<em>is</em> your attack.” No one who looks upon this “reasoning” exactly as it\nis could fail to see it does not follow, and it makes no sense. Yet it\nseems sensible because it <em>looks</em> as if the world were hurting you. And\nso it seems as if there is no need to go beyond the obvious in terms of\ncause.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> There is <em>indeed</em> a need. The world’s escape from condemnation is a\nneed which those within the world are joined in sharing. Yet they do not\nrecognize their common need. For each one thinks that if he does his\npart, the condemnation of the world will rest on him. And it is this\nthat he perceives to <em>be</em> his part in its deliverance. Vengeance must\nhave a focus. Otherwise is the avenger’s knife in his own hand and\npointed to himself. And he must see it in another’s hand if he would be\na victim of attack he did not choose. And thus he suffers from the\nwounds a knife he does not hold has made upon himself. This is the\n<em>purpose</em> of the world he sees. And looked at thus, the world provides\nthe means by which this purpose seems to be fulfilled.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> The means <em>attest</em> the purpose but are not themselves a cause. Nor\nwill the cause be changed by seeing it apart from its effects. The cause\n<em>produces</em> the effects which then bear witness to the cause and not\nthemselves. Look, then, beyond effects. It is not here the cause of\nsuffering and sin must lie. And dwell not on the suffering and sin, for\nthey are but reflections of their cause.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> The part you play in salvaging the world from condemnation is your\n<em>own</em> escape. Forget not that the witness to the world of evil cannot\nspeak except for what has seen a need for evil in the world. And this is\nwhere your guilt was first beheld. In separation from your brother was\nthe first attack upon yourself begun. And it is this the world bears\nwitness to. Seek not another cause nor look among the mighty legions of\nits witnesses for its undoing. They <em>support</em> its claim on your\nallegiance. What conceals the truth is not where you should look to\n<em>find</em> the truth. The witnesses to sin all stand within one little\nspace. And it is <em>here</em> you find the cause of your perspective on the\nworld.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> Once you were unaware of what the cause of everything the world\nappeared to thrust upon you, uninvited and unasked, must really be. Of\none thing you were sure—of all the many causes you perceived as bringing\npain and suffering to you, your guilt was not among them. Nor did you in\nany way request them for yourself. This is how <em>all</em> illusions come\nabout. The one who makes them does not see himself as making them, and\ntheir reality does not depend on him. Whatever cause they have is\nsomething quite apart from him, and what he sees is <em>separate</em> from his\nmind. He cannot doubt his dreams’ reality because he does not see the\npart he plays in making them and making them seem real.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> No one can waken from a dream the world is dreaming <em>for</em> him. He\nbecomes a part of someone else’s dream. He cannot choose to waken from a\ndream he did not make. Helpless he stands, a victim to a dream conceived\nand cherished by a separate mind. Careless indeed of him this mind must\nbe, as thoughtless of his peace and happiness as is the weather or the\ntime of day. It loves him not but casts him as it will in any role that\nsatisfies its dream. So little is his worth that he is but a dancing\nshadow, leaping up and down according to a senseless plot conceived\nwithin the idle dreaming of the world.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> This is the only picture you can see, the one alternative that you\ncan choose, the other possibility of cause if you be <em>not</em> the dreamer\nof your dreams. And this is what you choose if you deny the cause of\nsuffering is in <em>your</em> mind. Be glad indeed it is, for thus are you the\n<em>one</em> decider of your destiny in time. The choice is yours to make\nbetween a sleeping death and dreams of evil or a happy wakening and joy\nof life. What could you choose between <em>but</em> life or death, waking or\nsleeping, peace or war, your dreams or your reality? Yet if the choice\nis really given you, then you must see the causes of the things you\nchoose between exactly <em>as</em> they are and <em>where</em> they are. What choices\ncan be made between two states, but one of which is clearly recognized?\nWho could be free to choose between effects when only one is seen as up\nto him?</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> An honest choice could never be perceived as one in which the choice\nis split between a tiny you and an enormous world, with different dreams\nabout the truth in you. The gap between reality and dreams lies not\nbetween the dreaming of the world and what you dream in secret. <em>They</em>\nare one. The dreaming of the world is but a part of your own dream you\ngave away and saw as if it were its start and ending both. Yet was it\nstarted by <em>your</em> secret dream, which you do not perceive, although it\ncaused the part you see and do not doubt is real. How could you doubt it\nwhile you lie asleep and dream in secret that its cause is real?</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> A brother separated from yourself, an ancient enemy, a murderer who\nstalks you in the night and plots your death, yet plans that it be\nlingering and slow—of this you dream. Yet underneath this dream is yet\nanother in which you become the murderer, the secret enemy, the\nscavenger and the destroyer of [the] brother and the world alike. Here\nis the <em>cause</em> of suffering, the space between your dreams and your\nreality. The little gap you do not even see, the birthplace of illusions\nand of fear, the time of terror and of ancient hate, the instant of\ndisaster, all are here. Here is the <em>cause</em> of unreality. And it is here\nthat it will be undone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> <em>You</em> are the dreamer of the world of dreams. No other cause it has,\nnor ever will. Nothing more fearful than an idle dream has terrified\nGod’s Son and made him think that he has lost his innocence, denied his\nFather, and made war upon himself. So fearful is the dream, so seeming\nreal, he could not waken to reality without the sweat of terror and a\nscream of mortal fear unless a gentler dream preceded his awaking and\nallowed his calmer mind to welcome, not to fear, the Voice that calls\nwith love to waken him. [A gentler dream, in which his suffering was\nhealed and where his brother was his friend.] God willed he waken\ngently and with joy. And gave him means to waken without fear. Accept\nthe dream He gave instead of yours. It is not difficult to [shift] a\ndream when once the dreamer has been recognized.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> Rest in the Holy Spirit and allow His gentle dreams to take the place\nof those you dreamed in terror and in fear of death. He brings forgiving\ndreams in which the choice is not who is the murderer and who shall be\nthe victim. In the dreams He brings, there <em>is</em> no murder and there <em>is</em>\nno death. The dream of guilt is fading from your sight, although your\neyes are closed. A smile has come to lighten up your sleeping face. The\nsleep is peaceful now, for these are happy dreams.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> Dream softly of your sinless brother, who unites with you in holy\ninnocence. And from this dream, the Lord of Heaven will Himself awaken\nHis beloved Son. Dream of your brother’s kindnesses instead of dwelling\nin your dreams on his mistakes. Select his thoughtfulness to dream about\ninstead of counting up the hurts he gave. Forgive him his illusions and\ngive thanks to him for all the helpfulness he gave. And do not brush\naside his many gifts because he is not perfect in your dreams.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> He represents his Father, Whom you see as offering both life and\ndeath to you. Brother, He gives but life. Yet what you see as gifts your\nbrother offers represent the gifts you dream your Father gives to you.\nLet all your brother’s gifts be seen in light of charity and kindness\noffered you. And let no pain disturb your dream of deep appreciation for\nhis gifts to you.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>77</sup> The body is the central figure in the dreaming of the world. There is\nno dream without it, nor does it exist without the dream, in which it\nacts as if it were a person, to be seen and be believed. It takes the\ncentral place in every dream, which tells the story of how it was made\nby other bodies, born into the world outside the body, lives a little\nwhile and dies, to be united in the dust with other bodies dying like\nitself. In the brief time allotted it to live, it seeks for other bodies\nas its friends and enemies. Its safety is its main concern. Its comfort\nis its guiding rule. It tries to look for pleasure and avoid the things\nthat would be hurtful. Above all, it tries to teach itself its pains and\njoys are different and can be told apart.</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> The dreaming of the world takes many forms, because the body seeks in\nmany ways to prove it is autonomous and real. It puts things on itself\nwhich it has bought with little metal discs or paper strips the world\nproclaims as valuable and good. It works to get them, doing senseless\nthings, and tosses them away for senseless things it does not need and\ndoes not even want. It hires other bodies, that they may protect it, and\ncollect more senseless things that it can call its own. It looks about\nfor special bodies which can share its dream. Sometimes it dreams it is\na conqueror of bodies weaker than itself. But in some phases of the\ndream, it is the slave of bodies that would hurt and torture it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> The body’s serial adventures from the time of birth to dying is the\ntheme of every dream the world has ever had. The “hero” of this dream\nwill never change nor will its purpose. Though the dream itself takes\nmany forms and seems to show a great variety of places and events\nwherein its “hero” finds itself, the dream has but one purpose, taught\nin many ways. This single lesson does it try to teach again, and still\nagain, and yet once more that it is <em>cause</em> and <em>not</em> effect. And <em>you</em>\nare its effect and <em>cannot</em> be its cause.</p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> Thus are you not the dreamer but the <em>dream</em>. And so you wander idly\nin and out of places and events which <em>it</em> contrives. That this is all\nthe body does is true, for it <em>is</em> but a figure in a dream. But who\nreacts to figures in a dream unless he sees them as if they were real?\nThe instant that he sees them as they <em>are</em>, they have no more effects\non him because he understands he <em>gave</em> them their effects by causing\nthem and making them seem real.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> How willing are you to escape effects of all the dreams the world has\never had? Is it your wish to let no dream appear to be the cause of what\nit is you do? Then let us merely look upon the dream’s beginning, for\nthe part you see is but the second part, whose cause lies in the first.\nNo one asleep and dreaming in the world remembers his attack upon\nhimself. No one believes there really was a time when he knew nothing of\na body and could never have conceived this world as real. He would have\nseen at once that these ideas are one illusion, too ridiculous for\nanything but to be laughed away. How serious they now appear to be! And\nno one can remember when they would have met with laughter and with\ndisbelief.</p>\n\n<p><sup>82</sup> We <em>can</em> remember this if we but look directly at their cause. And we\nwill see the grounds for laughter, not a cause for fear. Let us return\nthe dream he gave away unto the dreamer who perceives the dream as\nseparate from himself and done to him. Into eternity, where all is one,\nthere crept a tiny mad idea at which the Son of God remembered not to\nlaugh. In his forgetting did the thought become a serious idea and\npossible of both accomplishment and real effects. Together, we can laugh\nthem both away and understand that time cannot intrude upon eternity. It\n<em>is</em> a joke to think that time can come to circumvent eternity, which\n<em>means</em> there is no time.</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> A timelessness in which is time made real; a part of God which can\nattack itself; a separate brother as an enemy; a mind within a body, all\nare forms of circularity whose ending starts at its beginning, ending at\nits cause. The world you see depicts exactly what you thought you did.\nExcept that now you think that what you did is being done to you. The\nguilt for what you thought is being placed outside yourself and on a\nguilty world which dreams your dreams and thinks your thoughts instead\nof you. It brings its vengeance, not your own. It keeps you narrowly\nconfined within a body, which it punishes because of all the sinful\nthings the body does within its dream. You have no power to make the\nbody stop its evil deeds because you did not make it and cannot control\nits actions or its purpose or its fate.</p>\n\n<p><sup>84</sup> The world but demonstrates an ancient truth—you will believe that\nothers do to you <em>exactly</em> what you think you did to them. But once\ndeluded into blaming them, you will not see the cause of what they do\nbecause you <em>want</em> the guilt to rest on them. How childish is this\npetulant device to keep your innocence by pushing guilt outside yourself\nbut never letting go! It is not easy to perceive the jest when all\naround you do your eyes behold its heavy consequences, but without their\ntrifling cause. Without the cause do its effects seem serious and sad\nindeed. Yet they but follow. And it is their <em>cause</em> which follows\nnothing and is but a jest.</p>\n\n<p><sup>85</sup> In gentle laughter does the Holy Spirit perceive the cause and looks\nnot to effects. How else could He correct your error, who have\noverlooked the cause entirely? He bids you bring each terrible effect to\nHim that you may look together on its foolish cause and laugh with Him a\nwhile. <em>You</em> judge effects, but <em>He</em> has judged their cause. And by His\njudgment are effects removed. Perhaps you come in tears, but hear Him\nsay, “My brother, Holy Son of God, behold your idle dream in which this\ncould occur,” and you will leave the holy instant with your laughter and\nyour brother’s joined with His.</p>\n\n<p><sup>86</sup> The secret of salvation is but this: that <em>you</em> are doing this unto\nyourself. No matter what the form of the attack, this still is true.\nWhoever takes the role of enemy and of attacker, still is this the\ntruth. Whatever seems to be the cause of any pain and suffering you\nfeel, this is still true. For you would not react at all to figures in a\ndream you knew that <em>you</em> were dreaming. Let them be as hateful and as\nvicious as they may, they could have no effect on you unless you failed\nto recognize it is <em>your</em> dream. This single lesson learned will set you\nfree from suffering, whatever form it takes.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> The Holy Spirit will repeat this one inclusive lesson of deliverance\nuntil it has been learned, regardless of the form of suffering that\nbrings you pain. Whatever hurt you bring to Him He will make answer with\nthis very simple truth. For this one answer takes away the <em>cause</em> of\nevery form of sorrow and of pain. The form affects His answer not at\nall, for He would teach you but the single cause of all of them, no\nmatter what their form. And you will understand that miracles reflect\nthe simple statement,</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> <em><strong>I</strong> have done this thing, and it is this I would undo.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>89</sup> Bring, then, all forms of suffering to Him Who knows that every one\nis like the rest. He sees no differences where none exist, and He will\nteach you how each one is caused. None has a different cause from all\nthe rest, and all of them are easily undone by but a single lesson truly\nlearned. Salvation is a secret you have kept but from yourself. The\nuniverse proclaims it so. Yet to its witnesses you pay no heed at all.\nFor they attest the thing you do not <em>want</em> to know. They seem to keep\nit secret from you. Yet you need but learn you choose but <em>not</em> to\nlisten, <em>not</em> to see. How differently will you perceive the world when\nthis is recognized! When you forgive the world your guilt, <em>you</em> will be\nfree of it. Its innocence does <em>not</em> demand your guilt, nor does <em>your</em>\nguiltlessness rest on its sins.</p>\n\n<p><sup>90</sup> This is the obvious—a secret kept from no one but yourself. And it is\nthis that has maintained you separate from the world and kept your\nbrother separate from you. Now need you but to learn that <em>both</em> of you\nare innocent or guilty. The one thing that is impossible is that you be\nunlike each other; that they <em>both</em> be true. This is the only secret yet\nto learn. And it will be no secret you are healed.</p>\n\n",

This world was over long ago.\nThe thoughts that made it are no longer in the mind that thought of them\nand loved them for a little while.

    "content": "<p><sup>4</sup> The Holy Spirit can indeed make use of memory, for God Himself is\nthere. Yet this is not a memory of past events, but only of a present\nstate. You are so long accustomed to believe that memory holds only what\nis past that it is hard for you to realize it is a skill that can\nremember <em>now</em>. The limitations on remembering the world imposes on it\nare as vast as those you let the world impose on you. There <em>is</em> no link\nof memory to the past. If you would have it there, then there it is. But\nonly your <em>desire</em> made the link, and only you have held it to a part of\ntime where guilt appears to linger still.</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> The Holy Spirit’s use of memory is quite apart from time. He does not\nseek to use it as a means to keep the past, but rather as a way to let\nit <em>go</em>. Memory holds the message it receives and does what it is given\nit to do. It does not write the message nor appoint what it is for. Like\nto the body, it is purposeless within itself. And if it seems to serve\nto cherish ancient hate and offers you the pictures of injustices and\nhurts which you were saving, this is what you asked its message be, and\nthis is what it is. Committed to its vaults, the history of all the\nbody’s past is hidden there. All of the strange associations made to\nkeep the past alive, the present dead, are stored within it, waiting\nyour command that they be brought to you and lived again. And thus do\ntheir effects appear to be increased by time, which took away their\ncause.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> Yet time is but another phase of what does nothing. It works hand in\nhand with all the other attributes with which you seek to keep concealed\nthe truth about yourself. Time neither takes away nor can restore. And\nyet you make strange use of it, as if the past had caused the present,\nwhich is but a consequence in which no change can be made possible\nbecause its cause has gone. Yet change must have a cause that will\nendure or else it will not last. No change can be made in the present if\nits cause is past. Only the past is held in memory as you make use of\nit, and so it is a way to hold the past <em>against</em> the now.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> Remember <em>nothing</em> that you taught yourself, for you were badly\ntaught. And who would keep a senseless lesson in his mind when he can\nlearn and can preserve a better one? When ancient memories of hate\nappear, remember that their cause is gone. And so you cannot understand\nwhat they are for. Let not the cause that you would give them now be\nwhat it was which made them what they were or seemed to be. Be glad that\nit is gone, for this is what you would be pardoned from. And see instead\nthe new effects of cause accepted <em>now</em>, with consequences <em>here.</em> They\nwill surprise you with their loveliness. The ancient new ideas they\nbring will be the happy consequences of a cause so ancient that it far\nexceeds the span of memory which your perception sees.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> This is the Cause the Holy Spirit has remembered for you, when you\nwould forget. It is not past because He let It not be unremembered. It\nhas never changed because there never was a time in which He did not\nkeep It safely in your mind. Its consequences will indeed seem new\nbecause you thought that you remembered not their Cause. Yet was It\nnever absent from your mind, for it was not your Father’s Will that He\nbe unremembered by His [only] Son.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> What <em>you</em> remember never was. It came from causelessness which you\nconfused with cause. It can deserve but laughter when you learn you have\nremembered consequences which were causeless and could <em>never</em> be\neffects. The miracle reminds you of a Cause forever present, perfectly\nuntouched by time and interference—never changed from what It <em>is.</em> And\n<em>you</em> are Its effects, as changeless and as perfect as Itself. Its\nmemory does not lie in the past nor await the future. It is not revealed\nin miracles. They but remind you that It has not gone. When you forgive\nIt for your sins, It will no longer be denied.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> You who have sought to lay a judgment on your own Creator cannot\nunderstand it is not He Who laid a judgment on His Son. You would deny\nHim His effects, yet have they never been denied. There was no time in\nwhich His Son could be condemned for what was causeless and against His\nWill. What your remembering would witness to is but the fear of God. He\nhas not done the thing you fear. No more have you. And so your innocence\nhas not been lost. You need no healing to be healed. In quietness, see\nin the miracle a lesson in allowing Cause to have Its <em>own</em> effects and\ndoing nothing that would interfere.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> The miracle comes quietly into the mind that stops an instant and is\nstill. It reaches gently from that quiet time, and from the mind it\nhealed in quiet then, to other minds to share its quietness. And they\nwill join in doing nothing to prevent its radiant extension back into\nthe mind Which caused all minds to be. Born out of sharing, there can be\nno pause in time to cause the miracle delay in hastening to all unquiet\nminds and bringing them an instant’s stillness when the memory of God\nreturns to them. Their own remembering is quiet now, and what has come\nto take its place will not be wholly unremembered afterwards.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> He to Whom time is given offers thanks for every quiet instant given\nHim. For in that instant is His memory allowed to offer all its\ntreasures to the Son of God, for whom they have been kept. How gladly\ndoes He offer them unto the one for whom He has been given them! And His\nCreator shares His thanks because He would not be deprived of His\neffects. The instant’s silence that His Son accepts gives welcome to\neternity and Him and lets Them enter where They would abide. For in that\ninstant does the Son of God do nothing that would make himself afraid.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> How instantly the memory of God arises in the mind that has no fear\nto keep the memory away. Its own remembering has gone. There is no past\nto keep its fearful image in the way of glad awakening to present peace.\nThe trumpets of eternity resound throughout the stillness, yet disturb\nit not. And what is now remembered is not fear, but rather is the cause\nthat fear was made to render unremembered and undone. The stillness\nspeaks in gentle sounds of love the Son of God remembers from before his\nown remembering came in between the present and the past to shut them\nout.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> Now is the Son of God at last aware of present Cause and Its benign\neffects. Now does he understand what he has made is causeless, making no\neffects at all. He has done nothing. And in seeing this, he understands\nhe never had a need for doing anything and never did. His Cause <em>is</em> Its\neffects. There never was a cause beside It that could generate a\ndifferent past or future. Its effects are changelessly eternal, beyond\nfear, and past the world of sin entirely.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> What has been lost, to see the causeless not? And where is sacrifice,\nwhen memory of God has come to take the place of loss? What better way\nto close the little gap between illusions and reality than to allow the\nmemory of God to flow across it, making it a bridge an instant will\nsuffice to reach beyond? For God has closed it with Himself. His memory\nhas not gone by and left a stranded Son forever on a shore where he can\nglimpse another shore which he can never reach. His Father wills that he\nbe lifted up and gently carried over. <em>He</em> has built the bridge, and it\nis He Who will transport His Son across it. Have no fear that He will\nfail in what He wills. Nor that you be excluded from the Will that is\nfor you.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>16</sup> Without a cause there can be no effects, and yet without effects\nthere is no cause. The cause a cause is <em>made</em> by its effects; the\nFather is a father by His Son. Effects do not create their cause, but\nthey establish its causation. Thus, the Son gives fatherhood to his\nCreator and receives the gift that he has given Him. It is <em>because</em> he\nis God’s Son that he must also be a father who creates as God created\nhim. The circle of creation has no end. Its starting and its ending are\nthe same. But in itself it holds the universe of all creation, without\nbeginning and without an end.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> Fatherhood <em>is</em> creation. Love must be extended. Purity is not\nconfined. It is the nature of the innocent to be forever uncontained,\nwithout a barrier or limitation. Thus is purity not of the body. Nor can\nit be found where limitation is. The body can be healed by its effects,\nwhich are as limitless as is itself. Yet must all healing come about\nbecause the mind is recognized as not within the body, and its innocence\nis quite apart from it and where <em>all</em> healing is. Where then is\nhealing? Only where its cause is given its effects. For sickness is a\nmeaningless attempt to give effects to causelessness and <em>make</em> it be a\ncause.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> Always in sickness does the Son of God attempt to make himself his\ncause and not allow himself to be his Father’s Son. For this impossible\ndesire, he does not believe that he is Love’s effect and must be cause\nbecause of what he is. The cause of healing is the only Cause of\neverything. It has but <em>one</em> effect. And in that recognition,\ncauselessness is given no effects and none are seen. A mind within a\nbody and a world of other bodies, each with separate minds, are your\n“creations,” you the “other” mind, creating with effects unlike\nyourself. And as their “father,” you must be like them. Nothing at all\nhas happened but that you have put yourself to sleep and dreamed a dream\nin which you were an alien to yourself and but a part of someone else’s\ndream.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> The miracle does not awaken you but merely shows you who the dreamer\n<em>is</em>. It teaches you there is a choice of dreams while you are still\nasleep, depending on the purpose of your dreaming. Do you wish for\ndreams of healing or for dreams of death? A dream is like a memory in\nthat it pictures what you <em>wanted</em> shown to you. An empty storehouse\nwith an open door holds all your shreds of memories and dreams. Yet if\nyou are the dreamer, you perceive this much at least—that <em>you</em> have\ncaused the dream and can accept another dream as well. But for this\nchange in content of the dream, it must be realized that it is you who\ndreamed the dreaming that you do not like. It is but an effect which\n<em>you</em> have caused, and you would not <em>be</em> cause of this effect.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> In dreams of murder and attack are you the victim in a dying body\nslain. But in forgiving dreams is no one asked to be the victim and the\nsufferer. These are the happy dreams the miracle exchanges for your own.\nIt does not ask you make another—only that you see you made the one you\nwould exchange for this. This world is causeless, as is every dream that\nanyone has dreamed within the world. No plans are possible and no design\nexists that could be found and understood.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> What else could be expected from a thing that has no cause? Yet if it\nhas no cause, it has no purpose. You may cause a dream, but never will\nyou give it real effects. For that would change its cause, and it is\nthis you cannot do. The dreamer of a dream is not awake but does not\nknow he sleeps. He sees illusions of himself as sick or well, depressed\nor happy, but without a stable cause with guaranteed effects.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> The miracle establishes you dream a dream and that its content is not\ntrue. This is a crucial step in dealing with illusions. No one is afraid\nof them when he perceives he made them up. The fear was held in place\n<em>because</em> he did not see that he was author of the dream, and not a\nfigure in the dream. He gives <em>himself</em> the consequences which he dreams\nhe gave his brother. And it is but this the dream has put together and\nhas offered him to show him that his wishes have been done. Thus does he\nfear his <em>own</em> attack but sees it at another’s hands. As victim, he is\nsuffering from its effects but not their cause. He authored not his own\nattack, and he is innocent of what he caused. The miracle does nothing\nbut to show him that he has done nothing. What he fears is cause without\nthe consequences which would <em>make</em> it cause. And so it never was.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> The separation started with the dream the Father was deprived of His\neffects and powerless to keep them since He was no longer their Creator.\nIn the dream, the dreamer made himself, but what he made has turned\nagainst him, taking on the role of its creator as the dreamer had. And\nas he hated his Creator, so the figures in the dream have hated him. His\nbody is their slave which they abuse because the motives he has given it\nhave they adopted as their own. And hate it for the vengeance it would\noffer them. It is their vengeance on the body which appears to prove the\ndreamer could not be the maker of the dream. Effect and cause are first\nsplit off and then reversed, so that effect becomes a cause; the cause,\neffect.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> This is the separation’s final step with which salvation, which\nproceeds to go the <em>other</em> way, begins. This final step is an effect of\nwhat has gone before, appearing as a cause. The miracle is the first\nstep in giving back to cause the function of causation, not effect. For\nthis confusion has produced the dream, and while it lasts, will wakening\nbe feared. Nor will the call to wakening be heard, because it seems to\nbe the call to fear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> Like every lesson which the Holy Spirit requests you learn, the\nmiracle is clear. It demonstrates what He would have you learn and shows\nyou its effects are what you <em>want</em>. In His forgiving dreams are the\neffects of yours undone and hated enemies perceived as friends with\nmerciful intent. Their enmity is seen as causeless now, because they did\nnot make it. And you can accept the role of maker of their hate, because\nyou <em>see</em> that it has no effects. Now are you freed from this much of\nthe dream; the world is neutral, and the bodies which still seem to move\nabout as separate things need not be feared. And so they are not sick.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> The miracle returns the cause of fear to you who made it. But it also\nshows that, having no effects, it is not cause because the function of\ncausation is to have effects. And where effects are gone, there <em>is</em> no\ncause. Thus is the body healed by miracles because they show the mind\n<em>made</em> sickness and employed the body to be victim or effect of what it\nmade. Yet half the lesson will not teach the whole. The miracle is\nuseless if you learn but that the body can be healed, for this is not\nthe lesson it was sent to teach. The lesson is the <em>mind</em> was sick that\nthought the body could be sick; projecting out its guilt caused nothing\nand had no effects.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> This world is full of miracles. They stand in shining silence next to\nevery dream of pain and suffering, of sin and guilt. They are the\ndream’s alternative, the choice to be the dreamer rather than deny the\nactive role in making up the dream. They are the glad effects of taking\nback the consequence of sickness to its cause. The body is released\nbecause the mind acknowledges “this is not done to me, but <em>I</em> am doing\nthis.” And thus the mind is free to make another choice instead.\nBeginning here, salvation will proceed to change the course of every\nstep in the descent to separation, until all the steps have been\nretraced, the ladder gone, and all the dreaming of the world undone.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>28</sup> What waits in perfect certainty beyond salvation is not our concern.\nFor you have barely started to allow your first uncertain steps to be\ndirected up the ladder separation led you down. The miracle alone is\nyour concern at present. Here is where we must begin. And having\nstarted, will the way be made serene and simple in the rising up to\nwaking and the ending of the dream. When you accept a miracle, you do\nnot add your dream of fear to one that is already being dreamed. Without\nsupport, the dream will fade away without effects. For it is <em>your</em>\nsupport that strengthens it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> No mind is sick until another mind agrees that they are separate. And\nthus it is their <em>joint</em> decision to be sick. If you withhold agreement\nand accept the part <em>you</em> play in making sickness real, the other mind\ncannot project its guilt without your aid in letting it perceive itself\nas separate and apart from you. Thus is the body not perceived as sick\nby both your minds, from separate points of view. Uniting with a\nbrother’s mind prevents the <em>cause</em> of sickness and perceived effects.\nHealing is the effect of minds which join, as sickness comes from minds\nwhich separate.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> The miracle does nothing just <em>because</em> the minds are joined and\ncannot separate. Yet in the dreaming has this been reversed, and\nseparate minds are seen as bodies which are separated and which cannot\njoin. Do not allow your brother to be sick, for if he is, have you\nabandoned him to his own dream by sharing it with him. He has not seen\nthe cause of sickness where it is, and you have overlooked the gap\nbetween you, where the sickness has been bred. Thus are you <em>joined</em> in\nsickness, to preserve the little gap unhealed, where sickness is kept\ncarefully protected, cherished, and upheld by firm belief, lest God\nshould come to bridge the little gap that leads to Him. Fight not His\ncoming with illusions, for it is His coming that you want above all\nthings that seem to glisten in the dream.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> The end of dreaming is the end of fear, and love was never in the\nworld of dreams. The gap <em>is</em> little. Yet it holds the seeds of\npestilence and every form of ill because it is a wish to keep apart and\nnot to join. And thus it seems to give a cause to sickness which is\n<em>not</em> its cause. The <em>purpose</em> of the gap is all the cause that sickness\nhas. For it was made to keep you separated in a body which you see as if\n<em>it</em> were the cause of pain.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> The cause of pain is separation, not the body, which is only its\neffect. Yet separation is but empty space, enclosing nothing, doing\nnothing, and as unsubstantial as the empty place between the ripples\nthat a ship has made in passing by. And covered just as fast, as water\nrushes in to close the gap and as the waves in joining cover it. Where\nis the gap between the waves when they have joined and covered up the\nspace which seemed to keep them separate for a little while? Where are\nthe grounds for sickness when the minds have joined to close the little\ngap between them where the seeds of sickness seemed to grow?</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> God builds the bridge, but only in the space left clean and vacant by\nthe miracle. The seeds of sickness and the shame of [sin] He cannot\nbridge, for He cannot destroy the alien will that He created not. Let\nits effects be gone and clutch them not with eager hands, to keep them\nfor yourself. The miracle will brush them all aside and thus make room\nfor Him Who wills to come and bridge His Son’s returning to Himself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> Count, then, the silver miracles and golden dreams of happiness as\nall the treasures you would keep within the storehouse of the world. The\ndoor is open, not to thieves but to your starving brothers who mistook\nfor gold the shining of a pebble and who stored a heap of snow that\nshone like silver. They have nothing left behind the open door. What is\nthe world except a little gap perceived to tear eternity apart and break\nit into days and months and years? And what are you who live within the\nworld except a picture of the Son of God in broken pieces, each\nconcealed within a separate and uncertain bit of clay?</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> Be not afraid, but let your world be lit by miracles. And where the\ngap was seen to stand between you, join your brother there. And sickness\nwill be seen <em>without</em> a cause. The dream of healing in forgiveness lies\nand gently shows you that you never sinned. The miracle would leave no\nproof of guilt to bring you witness to what never was. And in your\nstorehouse it will make a place of welcome for your Father and your\nSelf. The door is open that all those may come who would no longer\nstarve and would enjoy the feast of plenty set before them there. And\nthey will meet with your invited Guests the miracle has asked to come to\nyou.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> This is a feast unlike indeed to those the dreaming of the world has\nshown. For here, the more that anyone receives, the more is left for all\nthe rest to share. The Guests have brought unlimited supply with Them.\nAnd no one is deprived or can deprive. Here is a feast the Father lays\nbefore His Son and shares it equally with him. And in Their sharing\nthere can <em>be</em> no gap in which abundance falters and grows thin. Here\ncan the lean years enter not, for time waits not upon this feast, which\nhas no end. For Love has set Its table in the space that seemed to keep\nyour Guests apart from you.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>37</sup> Accepting the Atonement for yourself means not to give support to\nsomeone’s dream of sickness and of death. It means that you share not\nhis wish to separate and let him turn illusions on himself. Nor do you\nwish that they be turned instead on you. Thus have they <em>no</em> effects.\nAnd you are free of dreams of pain because you let him be. Unless you\nhelp him, you will suffer pain with him because that is your wish. And\nyou become a figure in his dream of pain, as he in yours. So do you both\nbecome illusions and without identity. You could be anyone or anything,\ndepending on whose evil dream you share. You can be sure of just one\nthing—that you are evil, for you share in dreams of fear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> There is a way of finding certainty right <em>here</em> and <em>now.</em> Refuse to\nbe a part of fearful dreams whatever form they take, for you <em>will</em> lose\nidentity in them. You <em>find</em> yourself by not accepting them as causing\nyou and giving you effects. You stand apart from them but not apart from\nhim who dreams them. Thus you separate the dreamer from the dream and\njoin [with] one but let the other <em>go</em>. The dream is but illusion in\nthe mind. And with the mind you <em>would</em> unite, but <em>never</em> with the\ndream. It is the dream you fear and <em>not</em> the mind. You see them as the\nsame because you think that <em>you</em> are but a dream. And what is real and\nwhat is but illusion in yourself you do not know and cannot tell apart.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> Like you, your brother thinks he is a dream. Share not in his\nillusion of himself, for your identity depends on his reality. Think\nrather of him as a mind in which illusions still persist, but as a mind\nwhich brother is to you. He is not brother made by what he dreams, nor\nis his body, “hero” of the dream, your brother. It is his <em>reality</em> that\nis your brother, as is yours to him. Your mind and his are joined in\nbrotherhood. His body and his dreams but seem to make a little gap,\nwhere yours have joined with his.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> And yet, between your minds there <em>is</em> no gap. To join his dreams is\nthus to meet him not because his dreams would separate from you.\nTherefore, release him, merely by your claim on brotherhood and not on\ndreams of fear. Let him acknowledge who he is by not supporting his\nillusions by your faith, for if you do, you will have faith in <em>yours.</em>\nWith faith in yours, <em>he</em> will not be released, and <em>you</em> are kept in\nbondage to his dream. And dreams of fear will haunt the little gap,\ninhabited but by illusions which you have supported in each other’s\nminds.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> Be certain, if you do your part, he will do his, for he will join you\nwhere you stand. Call not to him to meet you in the gap between you, or\nyou must believe that it is your reality as well as his. You <em>cannot</em> do\nhis part, but this you <em>do</em> when you become a passive figure in his\ndream instead of dreamer of your own. Identity in dreams is meaningless\nbecause the dreamer and the dream are one. Who <em>shares</em> a dream must\n<em>be</em> the dream he shares because by sharing is a cause produced.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> You share confusion and you <em>are</em> confused, for in the gap no stable\nself exists. What is the same seems different because what is the same\nappears to be unlike. His dreams are yours because you <em>let</em> them be.\nBut if you took your own away would he be free of them and of his own as\nwell. Your dreams are witnesses to his, and his attest the truth of\nyours. Yet if you see there <em>is</em> no truth in yours, his dreams will\n[disappear before his eyes], and he will understand what <em>made</em> the\ndream.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> The Holy Spirit is in <em>both</em> your minds, and He is One because there\nis no gap that separates His Oneness from Itself. The gap between your\nbodies matters not, for what is joined in Him is <em>always</em> one. No one is\nsick if someone else accepts his union with him. His desire to be a sick\nand separated mind cannot remain without a witness or a cause. And\n<em>both</em> are gone if someone wills to be united with him. He has\ndream[ed] that he was separated from his brother who, by sharing not\nhis dream, has left the space between them vacant. And the Father comes\nto join His Son the Holy Spirit joined.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> The Holy Spirit’s function is to take the broken picture of the Son\nof God and put the pieces into place again. This holy picture, healed\nentirely, does He hold out to every separate piece that thinks it is a\npicture in itself. To each he offers his identity, which the whole\npicture represents, instead of just a little broken bit which he\ninsisted was himself. And when he sees <em>this</em> picture, he will recognize\nhimself. If you share not your brother’s evil dream, this <em>is</em> the\npicture that the miracle will place within the little gap, left clean of\nall the seeds of sickness and of sin. And here the Father will receive\nHis Son, because His Son was gracious to himself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> I thank you, Father, knowing you will come to close each little gap\nthat lies between the broken pieces of Your holy Son. Your holiness,\ncomplete and perfect, lies in every one of them. And they <em>are</em> joined\nbecause what is in one is in them all. How holy is the smallest grain of\nsand when it is recognized as being part of the completed picture of\nGod’s Son! The forms the broken pieces seem to take mean nothing. For\nthe whole is in each one. And every aspect of the Son of God is just the\nsame as every other part.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> Join not your brother’s dreams but join with <em>him</em>, and where you\njoin His Son, the Father is. Who seeks for substitutes when he perceives\nhe has lost nothing? Who would <em>want</em> to have the “benefits” of sickness\nwhen he has received the simple happiness of health? What God has given\ncannot <em>be</em> a loss, and what is not of Him has no effects. What then\nwould you perceive within the gap? The seeds of sickness come from the\nbelief that there is <em>joy</em> in separation, and its giving up would be a\n<em>sacrifice</em>. But miracles are the result when you do not insist on\nseeing in the gap what is not there. Your willingness to <em>let</em> illusions\ngo is all the Healer of God’s Son requires. He will place the miracle of\nhealing where the seeds of sickness were. And there will be <em>no</em> loss,\nbut <em>only</em> gain.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>47</sup> What is a sense of sickness but a sense of limitation? Of a splitting\n<em>off</em> and separating <em>from</em>? A gap perceived between [ourselves] and\nwhat is seen as health? The good is seen outside; the evil, in. And thus\nis sickness separating off the self from good and keeping evil in. God\nis the <em>alternate</em> to dreams of fear. Who shares in them can <em>never</em>\nshare in Him. But who withdraws his mind from sharing them <em>is</em> sharing\nHim. There is no other choice. Except you share it, nothing can exist.\nAnd <em>you</em> exist because God shared His Will with you, that His creation\nmight create.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> It is the <em>sharing</em> of the evil dreams of hate and malice, bitterness\nand death, of sin and suffering, [of] pain and loss, that makes them\nreal. Unshared, they are perceived as meaningless. The fear is gone from\nthem because you did not give them your support. Where fear has gone,\nthere love <em>must</em> come because there <em>are</em> but these alternatives. Where\none appears, the other disappears. And which you share becomes the only\none you have. You have the one which you accept, because it is the only\none you [<em>want</em>] to have. You share no evil dreams if you forgive the\ndreamer and perceive that he is not the dream he made. And so he cannot\nbe a part of yours, from which you <em>both</em> are free. Forgiveness\nseparates the dreamer from the evil dream and thus releases him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> Remember if you share an evil dream, you will believe you <em>are</em> the\ndream you share. And fearing it, you will not <em>want</em> to know your own\nIdentity because you think that <em>it</em> is fearful. And you <em>will</em> deny\nyour Self and walk upon an alien ground which your Creator did not make\nand where you seem to be a “something” you are not. You <em>will</em> make war\nupon your Self, which seems to be your enemy, and <em>will</em> attack your\nbrother as a part of what you hate. There <em>is</em> no compromise. You are\nyour Self or an illusion. What can be between illusion and the truth? A\nmiddle ground where you can be a thing that is not you must be a dream\nand cannot be the truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> You have conceived a little gap between illusions and the truth to be\nthe place where all your safety lies and where your Self is safely\nhidden by what you have made. Here is a world established that is sick,\nand this the world the body’s eyes perceive. Here are the sounds it\nhears—the voices which its ears were made to hear. Yet sights and sounds\nthe body can perceive are meaningless. It cannot see nor hear. It does\nnot know what seeing <em>is</em>, what listening is <em>for</em>. It is as little able\nto perceive as it can judge or understand or know. Its eyes are blind;\nits ears are deaf. It cannot think, and so it cannot have effects.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> What is there God created to be sick? And what that He created not\ncan be? Let not your eyes behold a dream, your ears bear witness to\nillusion. They were made to look upon a world that is not there, to hear\nthe voices that can make no sound. Yet are there other sounds and other\nsights which <em>can</em> be seen and heard and understood. For eyes and ears\nare senses without sense, and what they see and hear they but report. It\nis not they that hear and see, but <em>you</em>, who put together every jagged\npiece, each senseless scrap and shred of evidence, and make a witness to\nthe world you want. Let not the body’s ears and eyes perceive these\ncountless fragments seen within the gap which you imagined, and let them\npersuade their maker his imaginings [were] real.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> Creation proves reality because it shares the function all creation\nshares. It is not made of little bits of glass, a piece of wood, a\nthread or two perhaps, all put together to attest its truth. Reality\ndoes not depend on this. There <em>is</em> no gap which separates the truth\nfrom dreams and from illusions. Truth has left no room for them in any\nplace or time. For it fills every place and every time and makes them\nwholly indivisible.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> You who believe there <em>is</em> a little gap between you, do not\nunderstand that it is here that you are kept as prisoners in a world\nperceived to be existing here. The world you see does not exist because\nthe place where you perceive it is not real. The gap is carefully\nconcealed in fog, and misty pictures rise to cover it with vague,\nuncertain forms and changing shapes, forever unsubstantial and unsure.\nYet in the gap is <em>nothing</em>. And there <em>are</em> no awesome secrets and no\ndarkened tombs where terror rises from the bones of death. Look at the\nlittle gap, and you behold the innocence and emptiness of sin that you\nwill see within yourself when you have lost the fear of <em>recognizing</em>\nlove.</p>\n\n",

You shrink from what it sees and what it hears and hate\nits frailty and littleness. And you despise its acts but not your own.\nIt sees and acts for <em>you</em>. It hears <em>your</em> voice. And it is frail and\nlittle by <em>your</em> wish. It seems to punish you and thus deserve your\nhatred for the limitations which it brings to you. Yet you have made of\nit a symbol for the limitations which you want your <em>mind</em> to have and\nsee and <em>keep</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> The body <em>represents</em> the gap between the little bit of mind you call\nyour own and all the rest of what is <em>really</em> yours. You hate it, yet\nyou think it <em>is</em> your self and that without it would your self be lost.\nThis is the secret vow which you have made with every brother who would\nwalk apart. This is the secret oath you take again, whenever you\nperceive yourself attacked. No one can suffer if he does not see himself\nattacked and <em>losing</em> by attack. Unstated and unheard in consciousness\nis every pledge to sickness. Yet it is a promise to another to be hurt\nby him and to attack him in return.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> Sickness is anger taken out upon the body, so that <em>it</em> will suffer\npain. It is the obvious effect of what was made in secret, in agreement\nwith another’s secret wish to be apart from you, as you would be apart\nfrom him. Unless you <em>both</em> agree that is your wish, it can have no\neffects. Whoever says, “There <em>is</em> no gap between my mind and yours” has\nkept God’s promise, not his tiny oath to be forever faithful unto death.\nAnd by his healing is his brother healed.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> Let this be your agreement with each one—that you be one with him and\nnot apart. And he will keep the promise that you make with him because\nit is the one which he has made to God, as God has made to him. God\nkeeps His promises; His Son keeps his. In his creation did his Father\nsay, “You are beloved of Me and I of you forever. Be you perfect as\nMyself, for you can never be apart from Me.” His Son remembers not that\nhe replied “I will,” though in that promise he was born. Yet God reminds\nhim of it every time he does not share a promise to be sick but lets his\nmind be healed and unified. His secret vows are powerless before the\nWill of God, Whose promises he shares. And what he substitutes is not\nhis will, who has made promise of himself to God.</p>\n\n",

And it is only there that he could want for something he has not.\nA space where God is not, a gap between the Father and the Son is not\nthe will of either, who have promised to be one. God’s promise is a\npromise to <em>Himself</em>, and there is no one who could be untrue to what He\nwills as part of what He <em>is.</em> The promise that there is no gap between\nHimself and what He is cannot be false. What will can come between what\n<em>must</em> be one, and in Whose wholeness there can <em>be</em> no gap?</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> The beautiful relationship you have with all your brothers is a part\nof you because it is a part of God Himself. Are you not sick if you deny\nyourself your wholeness and your health, the Source of help, the Call to\nhealing, and the Call to heal? Your savior waits for healing, and the\nworld waits with him. Nor are you apart from it. For healing will be one\nor not at all, its oneness being where the healing lies. What could\ncorrect for separation but its opposite? There is no middle ground in\nany aspect of salvation. You accept it wholly or accept it not. What is\nunseparated must be joined. And what is joined cannot be separate.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> Either there is a gap between you and your brother, or you <em>are</em> as\none. There is no in between, no other choice, and no allegiance to be\nsplit between the two. A split allegiance is but faithlessness to both\nand merely sets you spinning round, to grasp uncertainly at any straw\nthat seems to hold some promise of relief. Yet who can build his home\nupon a straw and count on it as shelter from the wind? The body can be\nmade a home like this because it lacks foundation in the truth. And yet,\n<em>because</em> it does, it can be seen as <em>not</em> your home but merely as an\naid to help you reach the home where God abides.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> With <em>this</em> as purpose <em>is</em> the body healed. It is not used to\nwitness to the dream of separation and disease. Nor is it idly blamed\nfor what it did not do. It serves to help the healing of God’s Son, and\nfor <em>this</em> purpose it cannot <em>be</em> sick. It will not join a purpose not\nyour own, and you have <em>chosen</em> that it not be sick. All miracles are\nbased upon this choice and given you the instant it is made. No forms of\nsickness are immune because the choice cannot be made in terms of form.\nThe choice of sickness <em>seems</em> to be a form, yet it is one, as is its\nopposite. And <em>you</em> are sick or well accordingly.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> But never you alone. This world is but the dream that you can <em>be</em>\nalone and think without affecting those apart from you. To be alone must\nmean you are apart, and if you are, you cannot <em>but</em> be sick. This seems\nto prove that you must be apart. Yet all it means is that you tried to\nkeep a promise to be true to faithlessness. Yet faithlessness <em>is</em>\nsickness. It is like the house set upon straw. It seems to be quite\nsolid and substantial in itself. Yet its stability cannot be judged\napart from its foundation. If it rests on straw, there is no need to bar\nthe door and lock the windows and make fast the bolts. The wind <em>will</em>\ntopple it, and rain <em>will</em> come and carry it into oblivion.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> What is the sense in seeking to be safe in what was <em>made</em> for danger\nand for fear? Why burden it with further locks and chains and heavy\nanchors when its weakness lies not in itself but in the frailty of the\nlittle gap of nothingness whereon it stands? What <em>can</em> be safe which\nrests upon a shadow? Would you build your home upon what will collapse\nbeneath a feather’s weight?</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> Your home is built upon your brother’s health, upon his happiness,\nhis sinlessness, and everything his Father promised him. No secret\npromise you have made instead has shaken the Foundation of his home. The\nwinds will blow upon it, and the rain will beat against it but with no\neffect. The world will wash away, and yet this house will stand forever,\nfor its strength lies not within itself alone. It is an ark of safety,\nresting on God’s promise that His Son is safe forever in Himself. What\ngap can interpose itself between the safety of this shelter and its\nSource? From here the body can be seen as what it is and neither less\nnor more in worth than the extent to which it can be used to liberate\nGod’s Son unto his home. And with this holy purpose is it made a home of\nholiness a little while because it shares your Father’s Will with <em>you.</em></p>\n\n",

It is the symbol\nof a promise made to meet when you prefer and separate until you both\nelect to meet again. And then your bodies seem to get in touch and\nsignify a meeting-place to join. But always is it possible to go your\nseparate ways. Conditional upon the “right” to separate will you agree\nto meet from time to time and keep apart in intervals of separation,\nwhich protect you from the “sacrifice” of love. The body <em>saves</em> you,\nfor it gets away from total sacrifice and gives you time in which to\nbuild again your separate selves, which you believe diminish as you\nmeet.</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> The body <em>could</em> not separate your minds unless you wanted it to be a\ncause of separation and of distance seen between you. Thus do you endow\nit with a power that lies not within itself. And herein lies its power\nover <em>you</em>. For now you think that it determines when you meet and\nlimits your ability to make communion with each other’s mind. And now it\ntells you where to go and how to go there, what is feasible for you to\nundertake, and what you cannot do. It dictates what its health can\ntolerate and what will tire it and make it sick. And its “inherent”\nweaknesses set up the limitations on what you would do and keep your\npurpose limited and weak.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> The body <em>will</em> accommodate to this if you would have it so. It will\nallow but limited indulgences in “love,” with intervals of hatred in\nbetween. And it will take command of when to “love” and when to shrink\nmore safely into fear. It will be sick because you do not know what\nloving means. And so you <em>must</em> misuse each circumstance and everyone\nyou meet and see in them a purpose not your own.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> It is not love that asks a sacrifice. But fear <em>demands</em> the sacrifice\nof love, for in love’s presence fear cannot abide. For hate to be\nmaintained love <em>must</em> be feared and only sometimes present, sometimes\ngone. Thus is love seen as treacherous because it seems to come and go\nuncertainly and offer no stability to you. You do not see how limited\nand weak is your allegiance and how frequently you have demanded that\nlove go away and leave you quietly alone in “peace.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> The body, innocent of any goal, is your excuse for variable goals\n<em>you</em> hold and force the body to maintain.

There is a shock that comes to those who learn their savior is\ntheir enemy no more. There is a wariness that is aroused by learning\nthat the body is not real. And there are overtones of seeming fear\naround the happy message, “God is love.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> Yet all that happens when the gap is gone is peace eternal. Nothing\nmore than that, and nothing less. Without the fear of God, what could\ninduce you to abandon Him? What toys or trinkets in the gap could serve\nto hold you back an instant from His love?

Why does an easy path, so clearly marked it is\nimpossible to lose the way, seem thorny, rough, and far too difficult\nfor you to follow? Is it not because you see it as the road to hell\ninstead of looking on it as a simple way, without a sacrifice or any\nloss, to find yourself in Heaven and in God? Until you realize you give\nup nothing, until you understand there <em>is</em> no loss, you will have some\nregrets about the way that you have chosen. And you will not see the\nmany gains your choice has offered you. Yet though you do not see them,\nthey are there. Their <em>cause</em> has been effected, and they must be\npresent where their cause has entered in.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> You have accepted healing’s Cause, and so it must be you are healed.\nAnd being healed, the power to heal must also now be yours. The miracle\nis not a separate thing which happens suddenly, as an effect without a\ncause. Nor is it in itself a cause. But where its cause is must it be.\nNow is it caused, though not as yet perceived. And its effects are\nthere, though not yet seen. Look inward now, and you will not behold a\nreason for regret but cause indeed for glad rejoicing and for hope of\npeace.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> It <em>has</em> been hopeless to attempt to find the hope of peace upon a\nbattleground. It <em>has</em> been futile to demand escape from sin and pain of\nwhat was made to serve the function of <em>retaining</em> sin and pain. For\npain and sin are one illusion, as are hate and fear, attack and guilt\nbut one. Where they are causeless, their effects are gone, and love must\ncome wherever they are not. Why are you not rejoicing? You are free of\npain and sickness, misery and loss, and all effects of hatred and\nattack. No more is pain your friend and guilt your god, and you should\nwelcome the effects of love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup> Your Guest <em>has</em> come. You asked Him, and He came. You did not hear\nHim enter, for you did not wholly welcome Him. And yet His gifts came\nwith Him. He has laid them at your feet and asks you now that you will\nlook on them and take them for your own. He <em>needs</em> your help in giving\nthem to all who walk apart believing they are separate and alone. They\nwill be healed when you accept your gifts, because your Guest will\nwelcome everyone whose feet have touched the holy ground whereon you\nstand and where His gifts for them are laid.</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> You do not see how much you now can give because of everything you\nhave received. Yet He Who entered in but waits for <em>you</em> to come where\nyou invited Him to be. There is no other place where He can find His\nhost nor where His host can meet with Him. And nowhere else His gifts of\npeace and joy and all the happiness His Presence brings can be obtained.\nFor they are where He is Who brought them with Him that they might be\nyours. You cannot see your Guest, but you <em>can</em> see the gifts He\nbrought. And when you look on them, you will believe His Presence must\nbe there. For what you now can do could not be done without the love and\ngrace His Presence holds.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> Such is the promise of the living God—His Son have life and every\nliving thing be part of him, and nothing else have life. What <em>you</em> have\ngiven “life” is not alive and symbolizes but your wish to be alive apart\nfrom life, alive in death, with death perceived as life, and living,\ndeath. Confusion follows on confusion here, for on confusion has this\nworld been based, and there is nothing else it rests upon. Its basis\ndoes not change, although it seems to be in constant change. Yet what is\nthat except the state confusion really means? Stability to those who are\nconfused is meaningless, and shift and change become the law on which\nthey predicate their lives.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> The body does not change. It represents the larger dream that change\nis possible. To change is to attain a state unlike the one in which you\nfound yourself before. There <em>is</em> no change in immortality, and Heaven\nknows it not. Yet here on earth it has a double purpose, for it can be\nmade to teach opposing things. And they reflect the teacher who is\nteaching them. The body can <em>appear</em> to change with time, with sickness\nor with health, and with events that seem to alter it. Yet this but\nmeans the mind remains unchanged in its belief of what the purpose of\nthe body is.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> Sickness is a demand the body be a thing that it is not. Its\nnothingness is guarantee that it can <em>not</em> be sick. In your demand that\nit be more than this lies the idea of sickness. For it asks that God be\nless than all He really is. What, then, becomes of you, for it <em>is</em> you\nof whom the sacrifice is asked? For He is told that part of Him belongs\nto Him no longer. He must sacrifice your self, and in His sacrifice are\nyou made more, and He is lessened by the loss of you. And what is gone\nfrom Him becomes your god, protecting you from being part of Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> The body that is asked to be a god will be attacked because its\nnothingness has not been recognized. And so it seems to be a thing with\npower in itself. As something, it can be perceived and thought to feel\nand act and hold you in its grasp as prisoner to itself. And it can fail\nto be what you demanded that it be. And you will hate it for its\nlittleness, unmindful that the failure does not lie in that it is not\nmore than it should be but only in your failure to perceive that it is\nnothing. Yet its nothingness is your salvation, from which you would\nflee.</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> As “something” is the body asked to be God’s enemy, replacing what He\nis with littleness and limit and despair. It is His loss you celebrate\nwhen you behold the body as a thing you love, or look upon it as a thing\nyou hate. For if He be the sum of everything, then what is not in Him\ndoes not exist, and His completion <em>is</em> its nothingness. Your savior is\nnot dead, nor does he dwell in what was built as temple unto death. He\nlives in God, and it is this that makes him savior unto you, and <em>only</em>\nthis. His body’s nothingness releases yours from sickness and from\ndeath. For what is yours cannot be more nor less than what is his.</p>\n\n",

Could it be some dreams are kept and others wakened from? The\nchoice is not between which dreams to keep, but only if you want to live\nin dreams or to awaken from them. Thus it is the miracle does not select\nsome dreams to leave untouched by its beneficence. You cannot dream some\ndreams and wake from some, for you are either sleeping or awake. And\ndreaming goes with only one of these.</p>\n\n<p><sup>26</sup> The dreams you think you like would hold you back as much as those in\nwhich the fear is seen. For <em>every</em> dream is but a dream of fear, no\nmatter what the form it seems to take. The fear is seen within, without,\nor both. Or it can be disguised in pleasant form. But never is it absent\nfrom the dream, for fear is the material of dreams from which they all\nare made. Their form can change, but they cannot be made of something\nelse. The miracle were treacherous indeed if it allowed you still to be\nafraid because you did not <em>recognize</em> the fear. You would not then be\nwilling to awake, for which the miracle prepares the way.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> In simplest form it can be said attack is a response to function\nunfulfilled as <em>you</em> perceive the function. It can be in you or someone\nelse, but where it is perceived, it will be there it is attacked.\nDepression or assault must be the theme of every dream, for they are\nmade of fear.

And\neach one represents some function which you have assigned, some goal\nwhich an event, or body, or a thing <em>should</em> represent and <em>should</em>\nachieve for you. If it succeeds, you think you like the dream. If it\nshould fail, you think the dream is sad. But whether it succeeds or\nfails is not its core but just the flimsy covering.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> How happy would your dreams become if you were <em>not</em> the one who gave\nthe “proper” role to every figure which the dream contains. No one can\nfail but your <em>idea</em> of him, and there is no betrayal <em>but</em> of this. The\ncore of dreams the Holy Spirit gives is <em>never</em> one of fear. The\ncoverings may not appear to change, but what they mean <em>has</em> changed\nbecause they cover something else. Perceptions are determined by their\npurpose in that they seem to <em>be</em> what they are <em>for</em>. A shadow figure\nwho attacks becomes a brother giving you a chance to help if this\nbecomes the function of the dream. And dreams of sadness thus are turned\nto joy.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> What <em>is</em> your brother for? You do not know because <em>your</em> function\nis obscure to you. Do not ascribe a role to him which you imagine would\nbring happiness to you. And do not try to hurt him when he fails to take\nthe part which you assigned to him in what you dream your life was meant\nto be. He asks for help in every dream he has, and you have help to give\nhim if you see the function of the dream as He perceives its function,\nWho can utilize all dreams as means to serve the function given Him.\nBecause He loves the dreamer not the dream, each dream becomes an\noffering of love.

The still infinity of\nendless peace surrounds you gently in its soft embrace, so strong and\nquiet, tranquil in the might of its Creator; nothing can intrude upon\nthe sacred Son of God within. Here is the role the Holy Spirit gives to\nyou who wait upon the Son of God and would behold him waken and be glad.\nHe is a part of you, and you of him because he is his Father’s Son and\nnot for any purpose you may see in him. Nothing is asked of you but to\naccept the changeless and eternal that abide in him, for your Identity\nis there. The peace in you can but be found in him. And every thought of\nlove you offer him but brings you nearer to your wakening to peace\neternal and to endless joy.</p>\n\n<p><sup>33</sup> This sacred Son of God is like yourself—the mirror of his Father’s\nlove for you, the soft reminder of his Father’s love by which he was\ncreated and which still abides in him, as it abides in you. Be very\nstill and hear God’s Voice in him and let It tell you what his function\nis. He was created that you might be whole, for only the complete can be\na part of God’s completion, Which created you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> There is no gift the Father asks of you but that you see in all\ncreation but the shining glory of His gift to you. Behold His Son, His\nperfect gift in whom his Father shines forever and to whom is all\ncreation given as his own. Because he has it is it given you, and where\nit lies in him, behold your peace. The quiet that surrounds you dwells\nin him, and from this quiet come the happy dreams in which your hands\nare joined in innocence. These are not hands that grasp in dreams of\npain. They hold no sword, for they have left their hold on every vain\nillusion of the world. And being empty, they received instead a\nbrother’s hand in which completion lay.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> If you but knew the glorious goal that lies beyond forgiveness, you\nwould not keep hold on any thought, however light the touch of evil on\nit may appear to be. For you would understand how great the cost of\nholding anything God did not give in minds that can direct the hand to\nbless and lead God’s Son unto his Father’s house. Would you not <em>want</em>\nto be a friend to him, created by his Father as His home? If God esteems\nhim worthy of Himself, would <em>you</em> attack him with the hands of hate?\nWho would lay bloody hands on Heaven itself and hope to find its peace?\nYour brother thinks he holds the hand of death. Believe him not. But\nlearn instead how blessed are you who can release him just by offering\nhim yours.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> A dream is given you in which he is your savior, not your enemy in\nhate. A dream is given you in which you have forgiven him for all his\ndreams of death—a dream of hope you share with him instead of dreaming\nevil separate dreams of hate. Why does it seem so hard to share this\ndream? Because unless the Holy Spirit gives the dream its function, it\nwas made for hate and will continue in death’s services. Each form it\ntakes in some way calls for death. And those who serve the lord of death\nhave come to worship in a separated world, each with his tiny spear and\nrusted sword to keep his ancient promises to die.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> Such is the core of fear in every dream that has been kept apart from\nuse by Him Who sees a different function for a dream. When dreams are\nshared, they lose the function of attack and separation, even though it\nwas for this that every dream was made. Yet nothing in the world of\ndreams remains without the hope of change and betterment, for here is\nnot where changelessness is found. Let us be glad indeed that this is so\nand seek not the eternal in this world. Forgiving dreams are means to\nstep aside from dreaming of a world outside yourself. And leading\nfinally beyond all dreams unto the peace of everlasting life.</p>\n\n",

These questions are\nthe same in different form. Forgiveness <em>is</em> your peace, for herein lies\nthe end of separation and the dream of danger and destruction, sin, and\ndeath; of madness and of murder, grief and loss. This is the “sacrifice”\nsalvation asks and gladly offers peace instead of this.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> Swear not to die, you holy Son of God! You make a bargain that you\ncannot keep. The Son of Life cannot be killed. He is immortal as his\nFather. What he is cannot be changed. He is the only thing in all the\nuniverse that <em>must</em> be one. What seems eternal all will have an end.\nThe stars will disappear, and night and day will be no more. All things\nthat come and go, the tides, the seasons, and the lives of men; all\nthings that change with time and bloom and fade will not return. Where\ntime has set an end is not where the eternal is. God’s Son can never\nchange by what men made of him. He will be as he was and as he is, for\ntime appointed not his destiny nor set the hour of his birth and death.\nForgiveness will not change him. Yet time waits upon forgiveness that\nthe things of time may disappear because they have no use.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> Nothing survives its purpose. If it be conceived to die, then die it\nmust unless it does not take this purpose as its own. Change is the only\nthing that can be made a blessing here, where purpose is not fixed,\nhowever changeless it appears to be. Think not that you can set a goal\nunlike God’s purpose for you and establish it as changeless and eternal.\nYou can give yourself a purpose that you do not have. But you can <em>not</em>\nremove the power to change your mind and see another purpose there.\nChange is the greatest gift God gave to all that you would make eternal,\nto ensure that only Heaven would not pass away.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> You were not born to die. You cannot change, because your function\nhas been fixed by God. All other goals are set in time and change that\ntime might be preserved, excepting <em>one</em>. Forgiveness does not aim at\nkeeping time but at its ending when it has no use. Its purpose ended; it\nis gone. And where it once held seeming sway is now restored the\nfunction God established for His Son in full awareness. Time can set no\nend to its fulfillment nor its changelessness. There is no death because\nthe living share the function their Creator gave to them. Life’s\nfunction cannot be to die. It must be life’s extension, that it be as\none forever and forever without end.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> This world will bind your feet and tie your hands and kill your body\nonly if you think that it was made to crucify God’s Son. For even though\nit was a dream of death, you need not let it stand for this to you. Let\n<em>this</em> be changed, and nothing in the world but must be changed as well.\nFor nothing here but is defined as what you see it for. How lovely is\nthe world whose purpose is forgiveness of God’s Son! How free from fear,\nhow filled with blessing and with happiness! And what a joyous thing it\nis to dwell a little while in such a happy place! Nor can it be forgot\nin such a world, it <em>is</em> a little while till timelessness comes quietly\nto take the place of time.</p>\n\n",

Heaven cannot be found where it is not, and there\ncan be no peace excepting there. Each idol that you worship when God\ncalls will never answer in His place. There <em>is</em> no other answer you can\nsubstitute and find the happiness His answer brings. Seek not outside\nyourself. For all your pain comes simply from a futile search for what\nyou want, insisting where it must be found. What if it is not there? Do\nyou prefer that you be right or happy? Be you glad that you are told\nwhere happiness abides and seek no longer elsewhere. You <em>will</em> fail.\nBut it is given you to know the truth and not to seek for it outside\nyourself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> No one who comes here but must still have hope, some lingering\nillusion, or some dream that there is something outside of himself that\nwill bring happiness and peace to him. If everything is in him, this\ncannot be so. And therefore by his coming, he denies the truth about\nhimself and seeks for something <em>more</em> than everything, as if a part of\nit were separated off and found where all the rest of it is not. This is\nthe purpose he bestows upon the body—that it seek for what he lacks and\ngive him what would make himself complete. And thus he wanders aimlessly\nabout in search of something that he cannot find, believing that he is\nwhat he is not.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> The lingering illusion will impel him to seek out a thousand idols\nand to seek beyond them for a thousand more. And each will fail him, all\nexcepting one; for he will die and does not understand the idol that he\nseeks <em>is</em> but his death. Its form appears to be outside himself. Yet\ndoes he seek to kill God’s Son within and prove that he is victor over\nhim. This is the purpose every idol has, for this the role that is\nassigned to it, and this the role that cannot <em>be</em> fulfilled.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> Whenever you attempt to reach a goal in which the body’s betterment\nis cast as major beneficiary, you try to bring about your death. For you\nbelieve that you can suffer lack, and lack <em>is</em> death. To sacrifice is\nto give up and thus to be without and to have suffered loss. And by this\ngiving up is life renounced. Seek not outside yourself. The search\nimplies you are not whole within and fear to look upon your devastation\nand prefer to seek outside yourself for what you are.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> Idols must fall <em>because</em> they have no life, and what is lifeless\n<em>is</em> a sign of death. You came to die, and what would you expect but to\n<em>perceive</em> the signs of death you seek? No sadness and no suffering\nproclaims a message other than an idol found that represents a parody of\nlife which in its lifelessness is really death, conceived as real and\ngiven living form. Yet each must fail and crumble and decay because a\nform of death cannot be life, and what is sacrificed cannot be whole.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> All idols of this world were made to keep the truth within from being\nknown to you and to maintain allegiance to the dream that you must find\nwhat is outside yourself to be complete and happy. It is vain to worship\nidols in the hope of peace. God dwells within, and your completion lies\nin Him. No idol takes His place. Look not to idols. Do not seek outside\nyourself. Let us forget the purpose of the world the past has given it.\nFor otherwise, the future <em>will</em> be like the past and but a series of\ndepressing dreams in which all idols fail you one by one, and you see\ndeath and disappointment everywhere.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> To change all this and open up a road of hope and of release in what\nappeared to be an endless circle of despair, you need but to decide you\ndo not <em>know</em> the purpose of the world. You give it goals it does not\nhave, and thus do you decide what it is for. You try to see in it a\nplace of idols found outside yourself, with power to make complete what\nis within by splitting what you are between the two. You <em>choose</em> your\ndreams, for they are what you wish, perceived as if it had been given\nyou. Your idols do what you would have them do and have the power you\nascribe to them. And you pursue them vainly in the dream because you\nwant their power as your own.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> Yet where are dreams but in a mind asleep? And can a dream succeed in\nmaking real the pictures it projects outside itself? Save time, my\nbrothers; learn what time is <em>for</em>. And speed the end of idols in a\nworld made sad and sick by seeing idols there. Your holy minds are\naltars unto God, and where He is, no idols can abide. The fear of God is\nbut the fear of loss of idols. It is not the fear of loss of your\nreality. But you have made of your reality an idol which you must\nprotect against the light of truth. And all the world becomes the means\nby which this idol can be saved. Salvation thus appears to threaten life\nand offer death.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> It is not so. Salvation seeks to prove there <em>is</em> no death, and\n<em>only</em> life exists. The sacrifice of death is <em>nothing</em> lost. An idol\n<em>cannot</em> take the place of God. Let Him remind you of His love for you,\nand do not seek to drown His Voice in chants of deep despair to idols of\nyourself. Seek not outside your Father for your hope. For hope of\nhappiness is <em>not</em> despair.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>52</sup> What is an idol? Do you think you know? For idols are unrecognized as\nsuch and never seen for what they really are. That is the only power\nwhich they have. Their <em>purpose</em> is obscure, and they are feared and\nworshiped both <em>because</em> you do not know what they are for and why they\nhave been made. An idol is an image of your brother which you would\nvalue more than what he <em>is</em>. Idols are made that he may be replaced, no\nmatter what their form. And it is this which never is perceived and\nrecognized. Be it a body or a thing, a place, a situation or a\ncircumstance, an object owned or wanted, or a right demanded or\nachieved, it is the same.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> Let not their form deceive you. Idols are but substitutes for your\nreality. In some way, you believe they will complete your little self\n[and let you walk in] safety in a world perceived as dangerous, with\nforces massed against your confidence and peace of mind. They have the\npower to supply your lacks and add the value which you do not have. No\none believes in idols who has not enslaved himself to littleness and\nloss. And thus must seek beyond his little self for strength to raise\nhis head and stand apart from all the misery the world reflects. This is\nthe penalty for looking not within for certainty and quiet calm which\nliberates you from the world and lets you stand apart in quiet and in\npeace [unlimited].</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> An idol is a false impression or a false belief—some form of\nanti-Christ which constitutes a gap between the Christ and what you see.\nAn idol is a wish made tangible and given form and thus perceived as\nreal and seen outside the mind. Yet it is still a thought and cannot\nleave the mind that is its source. Nor is its form apart from the idea\nit represents. All forms of anti-Christ oppose the Christ and fall\nbefore His face like a dark veil which seems to shut you off from Him,\nalone in darkness. Yet the light is there. A cloud does not put out the\nsun. No more a veil can banish what it seems to separate nor darken by\none whit the light itself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> This world of idols <em>is</em> a veil across the face of Christ because its\n<em>purpose</em> is to separate your brother from yourself. A dark and fearful\npurpose, yet a thought without the power to change one blade of grass\nfrom something living to a sign of death. Its form is nowhere, for its\nsource abides within your mind, where God abideth not. Where is this\nplace where what is everywhere has been excluded and been kept apart?\nWhat hand could be held up to block God’s way? Whose voice could make\ndemand He enter not? The “more-than-everything” is not a thing to make\nyou tremble and to quail in fear. Christ’s enemy is nowhere. He can take\nno form in which he <em>ever</em> will be real.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> What is an idol? Nothing! It must be believed before it seems to come\nto life and <em>given</em> power that it may be feared. Its life and power are\nits believer’s gift, and this is what the miracle restores to what <em>has</em>\nlife and power worthy of the gift of Heaven and eternal peace. The\nmiracle does not restore the truth, the light the veil between has not\nput out. It merely lifts the veil and <em>lets</em> the truth shine\nunencumbered, being what it is. It does not need belief to be itself,\nfor it <em>has been</em> created, so it <em>is.</em> An idol is <em>established</em> by\nbelief, and when it is withdrawn, the idol “dies.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> This is the anti-Christ—the strange idea there is a power past\nomnipotence, a place beyond the infinite, a time transcending the\neternal. Here the world of idols has been set by the idea this power and\nplace and time are given form and shape the world where the impossible\nhas happened. Here the deathless come to die, the all-encompassing to\nsuffer loss, the timeless to be made the slaves of time. Here does the\nchangeless change, the peace of God, forever given to all living things,\ngive way to chaos, and the Son of God, as perfect, sinless and as loving\nas his Father, come to hate a little while, to suffer pain, and finally\nto die.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> Where is an idol? Nowhere! Can there be a gap in what is infinite, a\nplace where time can interrupt eternity? A place of darkness set where\nall is light, a dismal alcove separated off from what is endless, <em>has</em>\nno place to be. An idol is beyond where God has set all things forever\nand has left no room for anything to be <em>except</em> His Will. Nothing and\nnowhere must an idol be while God is everything and everywhere.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> What purpose has an idol, then? What is it <em>for</em>? This is the only\nquestion which has many answers, each depending on the one of whom the\nquestion has been asked. The world <em>believes</em> in idols. No one comes\nunless he worshiped them and still attempts to seek for one that yet\nmight offer him a gift reality does not contain. Each worshiper of idols\nharbors hope his special deities will give him more than other men\npossess. It <em>must</em> be more. It does not really matter more of what—more\nbeauty, more intelligence, more wealth, or even more affliction and more\npain. But <em>more</em> of something is an idol <em>for</em>. And when one fails,\nanother takes its place with hope of finding more of something else. Be\nnot deceived by forms the “something” takes. An idol is a means for\ngetting <em>more</em>. And it is <em>this</em> that is against God’s Will.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> God has not many sons, but only One. Who can have more, and who be\ngiven less? In Heaven would the Son of God but laugh if idols could\nintrude upon his peace. It is for him the Holy Spirit speaks and tells\nyou idols <em>have</em> no purpose here. For more than Heaven can you never\nhave. If Heaven is within, why would you seek for idols which would make\nof Heaven less, to give you more than God bestowed upon your brother and\non you as one with Him? God <em>gave</em> you all there is. And to be sure you\ncould not lose it, did He also give the same to every living thing as\nwell. And thus <em>is</em> every living thing a part of you, as of Himself. No\nidol can establish you as <em>more</em> than God. But you will never be content\nwith being <em>less</em>.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>61</sup> The slave of idols is a <em>willing</em> slave. For willing he must be to\nlet himself bow down in worship to what has no life and seek for power\nin the powerless. What happened to the holy Son of God that this could\nbe his wish—to let himself fall lower than the stones upon the ground\nand look to idols that they raise him up? Hear then your story in the\ndream you made, and ask yourself if it be not the truth that you believe\nthat it is <em>not</em> a dream. A dream of judgment came into the mind that\nGod created perfect as Himself. And in that dream was Heaven changed to\nhell, and God made enemy unto His Son.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> How can God’s Son awaken from the dream? It is a dream of judgment.\nSo must he judge not, and he <em>will</em> waken. For the dream will seem to\nlast while he is part of it. Judge not, for he who judges <em>will</em> have\nneed of idols which will hold the judgment off from resting on himself.\nNor can he know the Self he has condemned. Judge not, because you make\nyourself a part of evil dreams where idols are your “true” identity and\nyour salvation from the judgment laid in terror and in guilt upon\nyourself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> All figures in the dream are idols made to save you from the dream.\nYet they are <em>part</em> of what they have been made to save you <em>from</em>. Thus\ndoes an idol <em>keep</em> the dream alive and terrible, for who could wish for\none unless he were in terror and despair? And this the idol represents,\nand so its worship <em>is</em> the worship of despair and terror and the dream\nfrom which they come. Judgment is an injustice to God’s Son, and it <em>is</em>\njustice that who judges him will not escape the penalty he laid upon\nhimself within the dream he made. God knows of justice, not of penalty.\nBut in the dream of judgment, you attack and are condemned and wish to\nbe the slave of idols which are interposed between your judgment and the\npenalty it brings.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> There <em>can</em> be no salvation in the dream as you are dreaming it. For\nidols must be part of it to save you from what you believe you have\naccomplished and have done to make you sinful and put out the light\nwithin you. Little children, it is there. You do but dream, and idols\nare the toys you dream you play with. Who has need of toys but children?\nThey pretend they rule the world and give their toys the power to move\nabout and talk and think and feel and speak for <em>them</em>. Yet everything\ntheir toys appear to do is in the minds of those who play with them. But\nthey are eager to forget that they made up the dream in which their toys\nare real, nor recognize their wishes are their own.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> Nightmares are childish dreams. The toys have turned against the\nchild who thought he made them real. Yet <em>can</em> a dream attack? Or <em>can</em>\na toy grow large and dangerous and fierce and wild? This does the child\nbelieve because he fears his thoughts and gives them to the toys\ninstead. And their reality becomes his own because they seem to <em>save</em>\nhim from his thoughts. Yet do they keep his thoughts alive and real but\nseen outside himself, where they can turn against him for his treachery\nto them. He thinks he <em>needs</em> them that he may escape his thoughts,\nbecause he thinks the thoughts are real. And so he makes of anything a\ntoy to make his world remain outside himself, and play that <em>he</em> is but\na part of <em>it.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> There is a time when childhood should be passed and gone forever.\nSeek not to retain the toys of children. Put them all away, for you have\nneed of them no more. The dream of judgment is a children’s game in\nwhich the child becomes the father, powerful, but with the little wisdom\nof a child. What hurts him is destroyed; what helps him, blessed. Except\nhe judges this as does a child, who does not know what hurts and what\nwill heal. And bad things seem to happen, and he is afraid of all the\nchaos in a world he thinks is governed by the laws he made. Yet is the\nreal world unaffected by the world he thinks is real. Nor have its laws\nbeen changed because he did not understand.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> The real world still is but a dream. Except the figures have been\nchanged. They are not seen as idols which betray. It is a dream in which\nno one is used to substitute for something else nor interposed between\nthe thoughts the mind conceives and what it sees. No one is used for\nsomething he is not, for childish things have all been put away. And\nwhat was once a dream of judgment now has changed into a dream where all\nis joy because that is the <em>purpose</em> which it has. Only forgiving dreams\ncan enter here, for time is almost over. And the forms which enter in\nthe dream are now perceived as brothers, not in judgment but in love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> Forgiving dreams have little need to last. They are not made to\nseparate the mind from what it thinks. They do not seek to prove the\ndream is being dreamed by someone else. And in these dreams a melody is\nheard which everyone remembers, though he has not heard it since before\nall time began. Forgiveness, once complete, brings timelessness so close\nthe song of Heaven can be heard, not with the ears, but with the\nholiness which never left the altar which abides forever deep within the\nSon of God. And when he hears this song again, he knows he never heard\nit not. And where is time, when dreams of judgment have been put away?</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> Whenever you feel fear in any form—and you <em>are</em> fearful if you do\nnot feel a deep content, a certainty of help, a calm assurance Heaven\ngoes with you—be sure you made an idol and believe it will betray you.\nFor beneath your hope that it will save you lie the guilt and pain of\nself-betrayal and uncertainty, so deep and bitter that the dream cannot\nconceal completely all your sense of doom. Your self-betrayal <em>must</em>\nresult in fear, for fear <em>is</em> judgment, leading surely to the frantic\nsearch for idols and for death.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> Forgiving dreams remind you that you live in safety and have not\nattacked yourself. So do your childish terrors melt away and dreams\nbecome a sign that you have made a new beginning, not another try to\nworship idols and to <em>keep</em> attack. Forgiving dreams are kind to\neveryone who figures in the dream. And so they bring the dreamer full\nrelease from dreams of fear. He does not fear his judgment, for he has\njudged no one, nor has sought to be released through judgment from what\njudgment must impose. And all the while he is remembering what he forgot\nwhen judgment seemed to be the way to <em>save</em> him from its penalty.</p>\n\n",

But it does occur at first,\n while you are learning how to hear.</p> <p><sup>7</sup> 2. Throughout the day, at any time you think of it and have a quiet\nmoment for reflection, tell yourself again the kind of day you want, the\nfeelings you would have, the things you want to happen to you, and the\nthings you would experience and say,</p> \n\n <p><sup>8</sup> <em>If I make no decision by myself,<br />\n This is the day that will be <strong>given</strong> me</em>.</p> \n\n <p><sup>9</sup> These two procedures, practiced well, will serve to let you be\n directed without fear, for opposition will not first arise and then\n become a problem in itself.</p> \n\n <p><sup>10</sup> But there will still be times when you have judged <em>already.</em> Now the\n answer will provoke attack unless you quickly straighten out your mind\n to want an answer that will work. Be certain this has happened if you\n feel yourself unwilling to sit by and ask to have the answer given you.\n This means you <em>have</em> decided by yourself and cannot see the <em>question</em>.\n Now you need a quick restorative before you ask.</p> <p><sup>11</sup> 3. Remember once again the day you want and recognize that something\nhas occurred which is not part of it. Then realize that you have asked a\nquestion by yourself and must have set an answer in your terms. Then\nsay,</p> \n\n <p><sup>12</sup> <em><strong>I have</strong> no question. I forgot what to decide.</em></p> \n\n <p><sup>13</sup> This cancels out the terms which you have set and lets the <em>answer</em>\n show you what the question must have really been.</p> \n\n <p><sup>14</sup> Try to observe this rule without delay despite your opposition. For\n you have <em>already</em> gotten angry, and your fear of being answered in a\n different way from what your version of the question asks will gain\n momentum until you believe the day you want is one in which you get\n <em>your</em> answer to <em>your</em> question. And you will not get it, for it would\n destroy the day by robbing you of what you <em>really</em> want. This can be\n very hard to realize when once you have decided by yourself the rules\n which promise you a happy day. Yet this decision still can be undone by\n simple methods which you can accept.</p> <p><sup>15</sup> 4. If you are so unwilling to receive you cannot even let your\nquestion go, you can begin to change your mind with this:</p> \n\n <p><sup>16</sup> <em>At least I can decide I do not <strong>like</strong> what I feel now.</em></p> \n\n <p><sup>17</sup> This much is obvious and paves the way for the next easy step.</p> <p><sup>18</sup> 5. Having decided that you do not like the way you feel, what could\nbe easier than to continue with,</p> \n\n <p><sup>19</sup> <em>And so I <strong>hope</strong> I have been wrong.</em></p> \n\n <p><sup>20</sup> This works against the sense of opposition and reminds you that help\n is not being thrust upon you but is something that you want and that you\n need, because you do not like the way you feel. This tiny opening will\n be enough to let you go ahead with just a few more steps you need to let\n yourself be helped.</p> \n\n <p><sup>21</sup> Now you have reached the turning point, because it has occurred to\n you that <em>you</em> will gain if what you have decided is not so. Until this\n point is reached, you will believe your happiness depends on being\n <em>right</em>. But this much reason have you now attained—you would be better\n off if you were <em>wrong</em>.</p> <p><sup>22</sup> 6. This tiny grain of wisdom will suffice to take you further. You\nare not coerced but merely hope to get a thing you want. And you can say\nin perfect honesty,</p> \n\n <p><sup>23</sup> <em><strong>I want</strong> another way to look at this.</em></p> \n\n <p><sup>24</sup> Now you have changed your mind about the day and have remembered what\n you <em>really</em> want. Its purpose has no longer been obscured by the insane\n belief you want it for the goal of being right when you are wrong. Thus\n is the readiness for asking brought to your awareness, for you cannot be\n in conflict when you ask for what you want and see that it <em>is</em> this for\n which you ask.</p> <p><sup>25</sup> 7. This final step is but acknowledgment of lack of opposition to be\nhelped. It is a statement of an open mind, not certain yet, but willing\nto be shown:</p> \n\n <p><sup>26</sup> <em>Perhaps there <strong>is</strong> another way to look at this.<br />\n What can I <strong>lose</strong> by asking?</em></p> \n\n <p><sup>27</sup> Thus you now can ask a question that makes\n sense, and so the answer will make sense as well. Nor will you fight\n against it, for you see that it is <em>you</em> who will be helped by it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> It must be clear that it is easier to have a happy day if you prevent\nunhappiness from entering at all. But this takes practice in the rules\nwhich will protect you from the ravages of fear. When this has been\nachieved, the sorry dream of judgment has forever been undone. But\nmeanwhile, you have need for practicing the rules for its undoing. Let\nus, then, consider once again the very first of the decisions which are\noffered here.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> We said you can begin a happy day with the determination not to make\ndecisions by yourself. This seems to be a real decision in itself. And\nyet, you <em>cannot</em> make decisions by yourself. The only question really\nis with <em>what</em> you choose to make them. That is really all. The first\nrule, then, is not coercion but a simple statement of a simple fact. You\nwill not make decisions by yourself <em>whatever</em> you decide. For they are\nmade with idols or with God. And you ask help of Christ or anti-Christ,\nand which you choose will join with you and tell you what to do.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> Your day is not at random. It is set by what you choose to live it\nwith and how the friend whose counsel you have sought perceives your\nhappiness. You always ask advice before you can decide on anything. Let\n<em>this</em> be understood, and you can see there cannot be coercion here nor\ngrounds for opposition that you may be free. There <em>is</em> no freedom from\nwhat must occur. And if you think there is, you must be wrong.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> The second rule as well is but a fact. For you and your advisor must\nagree on what you want before it can occur. It is but this <em>agreement</em>\nwhich permits all things to happen. Nothing can be caused without some\nform of union, be it with a dream of judgment or the Voice for God.\nDecisions cause results <em>because</em> they are not made in isolation. They\nare made by you and your advisor for yourself and for the world as well.\nThe day you want you offer to the world, for it will be what you have\nasked for and will reinforce the rule of your advisor in the world.\nWhose kingdom is the world for you today? What kind of day will you\ndecide to have?</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> It needs but two who would have happiness this day to promise it to\nall the world. It needs but two to understand that they cannot decide\nalone to guarantee the joy they asked for will be wholly shared. For\nthey have understood the basic law that makes decision powerful and\ngives it all effects that it will ever have. It needs but two. These two\nare joined before there <em>can</em> be a decision. Let this be the one\nreminder that you keep in mind, and you will have the day you want and\ngive it to the world by having it yourself. Your judgment has been\nlifted from the world by your decision for a happy day. And as you have\nreceived, so must you give.</p>\n\n",

God <em>asks</em> you do your\nwill. He joins with <em>you</em>. He did not set His Kingdom up alone. And\nHeaven itself but represents your will, where everything created is for\nyou. No spark of life but was created with your glad consent, as you\nwould have it be. And not one Thought that God has ever had but waited\nfor your blessing to be born. God is no enemy to you. He asks no more\nthan that He hear you call Him “Friend.”</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> How wonderful it is to do your will! For that is freedom. There is\nnothing else that ever should be called by freedom’s name. Unless you do\nyour will, you are not free. And would God leave His Son without what he\nhas chosen for himself? God but ensured that you would never lose your\nwill when He gave you His perfect answer. Hear it now that you may be\nreminded of His love and learn your will. God would not have His Son\nmade prisoner to what he does not want. He <em>joins</em> with you in willing\nyou be free. And to oppose Him is to make a choice against <em>yourself</em>\nand choose that <em>you</em> be bound.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> Look once again upon your enemy, the one you chose to hate instead of\nlove. For thus was hatred born into the world, and thus the rule of fear\nestablished there. Now hear God speak to you through Him Who is His\nVoice and yours as well, reminding you that it is not your will to hate\nand be a prisoner to fear, a slave to death, a little creature with a\nlittle life. Your will is boundless; it is not your will that it be\nbound. What lies in you has joined with God Himself in all creation’s\nbirth. Remember He Who has created you and through your will created\neverything. Not one created thing but gives you thanks, for it is by\nyour will that it was born. No light of Heaven shines except for you,\nfor it was set in Heaven by your will.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> What cause have you for anger in a world which merely waits your\nblessing to be free? If you be prisoner, then God Himself could not be\nfree. For what is done to him whom God so loves is done to God Himself.\nThink not He wills to bind you, Who has made you co-creator of the\nuniverse along with Him. He would but keep your will forever and forever\nlimitless.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> This world awaits the freedom you will give when you have recognized\nthat <em>you</em> are free. But you will not forgive the world until you have\nforgiven Him Who gave your will to you. For it is <em>by</em> your will the\nworld is given freedom. Nor can you be free apart from Him Whose holy\nwill you share. God turns to you to ask the world be saved, for by your\nown salvation it is healed. And no one walks upon the earth but must\ndepend on your decision, that he learn death has no power over him\nbecause he shares your freedom as he shares your will. It <em>is</em> your will\nto heal him, and because you have decided <em>with</em> him, he is healed. And\nnow is God forgiven, for you chose to look upon your brother as a\nfriend.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>38</sup> Idols are quite specific. But your will is universal, being\nlimitless. And so it has no form nor is content for its expression in\nthe terms of form. Idols are limits. They are the belief that there are\nforms which will bring happiness and that, <em>by</em> limiting, is all\nattained. It is as if you said, “I have no need of everything. This\nlittle thing I want, and it will be as everything to me.” And this must\nfail to satisfy because it is your will that everything be yours. Decide\nfor idols, and you <em>ask</em> for loss. Decide for truth, and everything <em>is</em>\nyours.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> It is not form you seek. What form can be a substitute for God the\nFather’s love? What form can take the place of all the love in the\ndivinity of God the Son? What idol can make two of what is one? And\n<em>can</em> the limitless be limited? You do not <em>want</em> an idol. It is not\nyour will to have one. It will not bestow on you the gift you seek. When\nyou decide upon the form of what you want, you lose the understanding of\nits purpose. So you see your will within the idol, thus reducing it to a\nspecific form. Yet this could never <em>be</em> your will because what shares\nin all creation cannot be content with small ideas and little things.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> Behind the search for every idol lies the yearning for completion.\nWholeness has no form because it is unlimited. To seek a special person\nor a thing to add to you to make yourself complete can only mean that\nyou believe some form is missing. And by finding this, you will achieve\ncompletion in a form you like. This is the <em>purpose</em> of an idol—that you\nwill not look beyond it to the source of the belief that you <em>are</em>\nincomplete. <em>Only</em> if you had sinned could this be so. For sin is the\nidea you are alone and separated off from what is whole. And thus it\nwould be necessary for the search for wholeness to be made <em>beyond</em> the\nboundaries of limits on yourself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> It never is the <em>idol</em> that you want. But what you think it offers\nyou, you want indeed and have the <em>right</em> to ask for. Nor could it be\npossible it be denied. Your will to be complete is but God’s Will, and\nthis is <em>given</em> you by being His. God knows not form. He cannot answer\nyou in terms which have no meaning. And your will could not be satisfied\nwith empty forms made but to fill a gap which is not there. It is not\nthis you <em>want.</em> Creation gives no separate person and no separate thing\nthe power to complete the Son of God. What idol can be called upon to\ngive the Son of God what he already has?</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> Completion is the <em>function</em> of God’s Son. He has no need to seek for\nit at all. Beyond all idols stands his holy will to be but what he is.\nFor more than whole is meaningless. If there were change in him, if he\ncould be reduced to any form and limited to what is not in him, he would\nnot be as God created him. What idol can he need to be himself? For can\nhe give a part of him away? What is not whole cannot make whole. But\nwhat is really asked for cannot <em>be</em> denied. Your will <em>is</em> granted. Not\nin any form that would content you not, but in the whole completely\nlovely Thought God holds of you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>43</sup> Nothing that God knows not exists. And what He knows exists forever,\nchangelessly. For thoughts endure as long as does the mind that thought\nof them. And in the Mind of God there is no ending nor a time in which\nHis Thoughts were absent or could suffer change. Thoughts are not born\nand cannot die. They share the attributes of their creator, nor have\nthey a separate life apart from his. The thoughts you think are in your\nmind, as you are in the mind Which thought of you. And so there are no\nseparate parts in what exists within God’s Mind. It is forever one,\neternally united and at peace.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> Thoughts seem to come and go. Yet all this means is that you are\nsometimes aware of them and sometimes not. An unremembered thought is\nborn again to you when it returns to your awareness. Yet it did not die\nwhen you forgot it. It was always there, but you were unaware of it. The\nThought God holds of you is perfectly unchanged by your forgetting. It\nwill always be exactly as it was before the time when you forgot and\nwill be just the same when you remember. And it is the same within the\ninterval when you forgot.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> The Thoughts of God are far beyond all change and shine forever. They\nawait not birth. They wait for welcome and remembering. The Thought God\nholds of you is like a star, unchangeable in an eternal sky. So high in\nHeaven is it set that those outside of Heaven know not it is there. Yet\nstill and white and lovely will it shine through all eternity. There was\nno time it was not there; no instant when its light grew dimmer or less\nperfect ever was.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> Who knows the Father knows this light, for He is the eternal sky\nwhich holds it safe, forever lifted up, and anchored sure. Its perfect\npurity does not depend on whether it is seen on earth or not. The sky\nembraces it and softly holds it in its perfect place, which is as far\nfrom earth as earth from Heaven. It is not the distance nor the time\nwhich keeps this star invisible to earth. But those who seek for idols\ncannot know this star is there.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> Beyond all idols is the Thought God holds of you. Completely\nunaffected by the turmoil and the terror of the world, the dreams of\nbirth and death that here are dreamed, the myriad of forms that fear can\ntake; quite undisturbed, the Thought God holds of you remains exactly as\nit always was. Surrounded by a stillness so complete no sound of battle\ncomes remotely near, it rests in certainty and perfect peace. Here is\nyour one reality kept safe, completely unaware of all the world that\nworships idols and that knows not God. In perfect sureness of its\nchangelessness and of its rest in its eternal home, the Thought God\nholds of you has never left the mind of its Creator Whom it knows, as\nits Creator knows that it is there.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> Where could the Thought God holds of you exist but where <em>you</em> are?\nIs your reality a thing apart from you and in a world which your reality\nknows nothing of? Outside you there is no eternal sky, no changeless\nstar, and no reality. The mind of Heaven’s Son in Heaven is, for there\nthe mind of Father and Son joined in creation which can have no end. You\nhave not two realities, but one. Nor can you be <em>aware</em> of more than\none. An idol <em>or</em> the Thought God holds of you is your reality. Forget\nnot, then, that idols must keep hidden what you are, not from the Mind\nof God, but from your own. The star shines still; the sky has never\nchanged. But you, the holy Son of God Himself, are unaware of your\nreality.</p>\n\n",

For the truth behind them\nis so lovely and so still in loving gentleness, were you aware of it you\nwould forget defensiveness entirely and rush to its embrace. The truth\ncould never be attacked. And this you knew when you made idols. They\nwere made that this might be forgotten. You attack but false ideas and\nnever truthful ones. All idols are the false ideas you made to fill the\ngap you think arose between yourself and what is true. And you attack\nthem for the things you think they represent. What lies beyond them\ncannot <em>be</em> attacked.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> The wearying, dissatisfying gods you made are blown-up children’s\ntoys. A child is frightened when a wooden head springs up as a closed\nbox is opened suddenly or when a soft and silent woolly bear begins to\nsqueak as he takes hold of it. The rules he made for boxes and for bears\nhave failed him and have broken his “control” of what surrounds him. And\nhe is afraid because he thought the rules protected him. Now must he\nlearn the boxes and the bears did not deceive him, broke no rules, nor\nmean his world is made chaotic and unsafe. <em>He</em> was mistaken. He\nmisunderstood what made him safe and thought that it had left.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> The gap that is not there is filled with toys in countless forms. And\neach one seems to break the rules you set for it. It never <em>was</em> the\nthing you thought. It must appear to break your rules for safety, since\nthe rules were wrong. But <em>you</em> are not endangered. You can laugh at\npopping heads and squeaking toys, as does the child who learns they are\nno threat to him. Yet while he likes to play with them, he still\nperceives them as obeying rules he made for his enjoyment. So there\nstill are rules which they can seem to break and frighten him. Yet <em>is</em>\nhe at the mercy of his toys? And <em>can</em> they represent a threat to him?</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> Reality observes the laws of God, and not the rules you set. It is\nHis laws which guarantee your safety. All illusions that you believe\nabout yourself obey <em>no</em> laws. They seem to dance a little while,\naccording to the rules you set for them. But then they fall and cannot\nrise again. They are but toys, my children. Do not grieve for them.\nTheir dancing never brought you joy. But neither were they things to\nfrighten you nor make you safe if they obeyed your rules. They must be\nneither cherished nor attacked but merely looked upon as children’s toys\nwithout a single meaning of their own. See one in them, and you will see\nthem all. See none in them, and they will touch you not.</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> Appearances deceive <em>because</em> they are appearances and not reality.\nDwell not on them in any form. They but obscure reality, and they bring\nfear <em>because</em> they hide the truth. Do not attack what you have made to\n<em>let</em> you be deceived, for thus you prove that you <em>have</em> been deceived.\nAttack <em>has</em> power to make illusions real. Yet what it makes is nothing.\nWho could be made fearful by a power that can have no real effects at\nall? What could it be but an illusion, making things appear like to\nitself? Look calmly at its toys and understand that they are idols which\nbut dance to vain desires. Give them not your worship, for they are not\nthere. Yet this is equally forgotten in attack. God’s Son needs no\ndefense against his dreams. His idols do not threaten him at all. His\none mistake is that he thinks them real. What can the power of illusions\n<em>do</em>?</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> Appearances can but deceive the mind that <em>wants</em> to be deceived. And\nyou can make a simple choice that will forever place you far beyond\ndeception. You need not concern yourself with how this will be done, for\nthis you cannot understand. But you <em>will</em> understand that mighty\nchanges have been quickly brought about when you decide one very simple\nthing—you do not <em>want</em> whatever you believe an idol gives. For thus the\nSon of God declares that he is free of idols. And thus <em>is</em> he free.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> Salvation is a paradox indeed! What could it be except a happy dream?\nIt asks you but that you forgive all things that no one ever did, to\noverlook what is not there, and not to look upon the unreal as reality.\nYou are but asked to let your will be done and seek no longer for the\nthings you do not want. And you are asked to let yourself be free of all\nthe dreams of what you never were and seek no more to substitute the\nstrength of idle wishes for the Will of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> Here does the dream of separation start to fade and disappear. For\nhere the gap that is not there begins to be perceived without the toys\nof terror that you made. No more than this is asked. Be glad indeed\nsalvation asks so little, not so much. It asks for <em>nothing</em> in reality.\nAnd even in illusions it but asks forgiveness be the substitute for\nfear. Such is the only rule for happy dreams. The gap is emptied of the\ntoys of fear, and then its unreality is plain. Dreams are for <em>nothing</em>.\nAnd the Son of God can have no need of them. They offer him no single\nthing that he could ever want. He is delivered from illusions by his\nwill and but restored to what he is. What could God’s plan for his\nsalvation be, except a means to give him to Himself?</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>57</sup> The real world is the state of mind in which the only purpose of the\nworld is seen to be forgiveness. Fear is not its goal, and the <em>escape</em>\nfrom guilt becomes its aim. The value of forgiveness is perceived and\ntakes the place of idols which are sought no longer, for their “gifts”\nare not held dear. No rules are idly set, and no demands are made of\nanyone or anything to twist and fit into the dream of fear. Instead,\nthere is a wish to understand all things created as they really are. And\nit is recognized that all things must be first forgiven, and <em>then</em>\nunderstood.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> Here, it is thought that understanding is <em>acquired</em> by attack.\nThere, it is clear that by attack is understanding <em>lost</em>. The folly of\npursuing guilt as goal is fully recognized. And idols are not wanted\nthere, for guilt is understood as the sole cause of pain in any form. No\none is tempted by its vain appeal, for suffering and death have been\nperceived as things not wanted and not striven for. The possibility of\nfreedom has been grasped and welcomed, and the means by which it can be\ngained can now be understood. The world becomes a place of hope because\nits only purpose is to be a place where hope of happiness can be\nfulfilled. And no one stands outside this hope because the world has\nbeen united in belief the purpose of the world is one which all must\nshare if hope be more than just a dream.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> Not yet is Heaven quite remembered, for the purpose of forgiveness\nstill remains. Yet everyone is certain he will go beyond forgiveness,\nand he but remains until it is made perfect in himself. He has no wish\nfor anything but this. And fear has dropped away because he is united in\nhis purpose with himself. There is a hope of happiness in him so sure\nand constant he can barely stay and wait a little longer with his feet\nstill touching earth. Yet is he glad to wait till every hand is joined\nand every heart made ready to arise and go with him. For thus is <em>he</em>\nmade ready for the step in which is all forgiveness left behind.</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> The final step is God’s because it is but God Who could create a\nperfect Son and share His Fatherhood with him. No one outside of Heaven\nknows how this can be, for understanding this is Heaven itself. Even the\nreal world has a purpose still beneath creation and eternity. But fear\nis gone because its purpose is forgiveness, not idolatry. And so is\nHeaven’s Son prepared to be himself, and to remember that the Son of God\nknows everything his Father understands and understands it perfectly\nwith Him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> The real world still falls short of this, for this is God’s own\npurpose—only His, and yet completely shared and perfectly fulfilled. The\nreal world is a state in which the mind has learned how easily do idols\ngo when they are still perceived, but wanted not. How willingly the mind\ncan let them go when it has understood that idols are nothing and\nnowhere and are purposeless. For only then can guilt and sin be seen\nwithout a purpose and as meaningless.</p>\n\n<p><sup>62</sup> Thus is the real world’s purpose gently brought into awareness, to\nreplace the goal of sin and guilt. And all that stood between your image\nof yourself and what you are, forgiveness washes joyfully away. Yet God\nneed not create His Son again that what is his be given back to him. The\ngap between your brother and yourself was never <em>there</em>. And what the\nSon of God knew in creation, he must know again.</p>\n\n<p><sup>63</sup> When brothers join in purpose in the world of fear, they stand\nalready at the edge of the real world. Perhaps they still look back and\nthink they see an idol that they want. Yet has their path been surely\nset away from idols toward reality. For when they joined their hands, it\nwas Christ’s hand they took, and they will look on Him Whose hand they\nhold. The face of Christ is looked upon before the Father is remembered.\nFor He must be unremembered till His Son has reached beyond forgiveness\nto the love of God. Yet is the love of Christ accepted first. And then\nwill come the knowledge They are One.</p>\n\n<p><sup>64</sup> How light and easy is the step across the narrow boundaries of the\nworld of fear when you have recognized Whose hand you hold! Within your\nhand is everything you need to walk with perfect confidence away from\nfear forever and to go straight on and quickly reach the gate of Heaven\nitself. For He Whose hand you hold was waiting but for you to join Him.\nNow that you have come, would <em>He</em> delay in showing you the way that He\nmust walk with you? His blessing lies on you as surely as His Father’s\nlove rests upon Him. His gratitude to you is past your understanding,\nfor you have enabled Him to rise from chains and go with you together to\nHis Father’s house.</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> An ancient hate is passing from the world. And with it goes all\nhatred and all fear. Look back no longer, for what lies ahead is all you\never wanted in your hearts. Give up the world! But not to sacrifice. You\nnever <em>wanted</em> it. What happiness have you sought here that did not\nbring you pain? What moment of content has not been bought at fearful\nprice in coins of suffering? Joy <em>has</em> no cost. It is your sacred right,\nand what you pay for is not happiness. Be speeded on your way by\nhonesty, and let not your experiences here deceive in retrospect. They\nwere not free from bitter cost and joyless consequence.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> Do not look back except in honesty. And when an idol tempts you,\nthink of this:</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> <em>There never was a time an idol brought you anything except the\n“gift” of guilt. Not one was bought except at cost of pain, nor was it\never paid by you alone.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>68</sup> Be merciful unto your brother, then. And do not choose an idol\nthoughtlessly, remembering that he will pay the cost as well as you. For\nhe will be delayed when you look back, and you will not perceive Whose\nloving hand you hold. Look forward, then, and walk in confidence with\nhappy hearts that beat in hope and do not pound in fear.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> The Will of God forever lies in those whose hands are joined. Until\nthey joined, they thought He was their enemy. But when they joined and\nshared a purpose, they were free to learn their will is one. And thus\nthe Will of God must reach to their awareness. Nor can they forget for\nlong that it is but their own.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>70</sup> Anger is <em>never</em> justified. Attack has <em>no</em> foundation. It is here\nescape from fear begins and will be made complete. Here is the real\nworld given in exchange for dreams of terror. For it is on this\nforgiveness rests and is but natural. You are not asked to offer pardon\nwhere attack is due and would be justified. For this would mean that you\nforgive a sin by overlooking what is really there. This is not pardon.\nFor it would assume that, by responding in a way which is not justified,\nyour pardon will become the answer to attack that has been made. And\nthus is pardon inappropriate, by being granted where it is not due.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> Pardon is <em>always</em> justified. It has a <em>sure</em> foundation. You do not\nforgive the unforgivable nor overlook a real attack that calls for\npunishment. Salvation does not lie in being asked to make unnatural\nresponses which are inappropriate to what is real. Instead, it merely\nasks that you respond appropriately to what is not real by not\nperceiving what has not occurred. If pardon were unjustified, you would\nbe asked to sacrifice your rights when you return forgiveness for\nattack. But you are merely asked to see forgiveness as the natural\nreaction to distress which rests on error and thus calls for help.\nForgiveness is the <em>only</em> sane response. It <em>keeps</em> your rights from\nbeing sacrificed.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> This understanding is the only change that lets the real world rise\nto take the place of dreams of terror. Fear cannot arise unless attack\nis justified, and if it had a real foundation, pardon would have none.\nThe real world is achieved when you perceive the basis of forgiveness is\nquite real and fully justified. While you regard it as a gift\nunwarranted, it must <em>uphold</em> the guilt you would “forgive.” Unjustified\nforgiveness <em>is</em> attack. And this is all the world can ever give. It\npardons “sinners” sometimes but remains aware that they have sinned. And\nso they do not merit the forgiveness that it gives.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> This is the false forgiveness which the world employs to <em>keep</em> the\nsense of sin alive. And recognizing God is just, it seems impossible His\npardon could be real. Thus is the fear of God the sure result of seeing\npardon as unmerited. No one who sees himself as guilty can avoid the\nfear of God. But he is saved from this dilemma if he can forgive. The\nmind must think of its Creator as it looks upon itself. If you can see\nyour brother merits pardon, you have learned forgiveness is your right\nas much as his. Nor will you think that God intends for you a fearful\njudgment which your brother does not merit. For it is the truth that you\ncan merit neither more nor less than he.</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> Forgiveness recognized as merited will heal. It gives the miracle its\nstrength to overlook illusions. This is how you learn that you must be\nforgiven too. There can be no appearance that can <em>not</em> be overlooked.\nFor if there were, it would be necessary first there be some sin which\nstands beyond forgiveness. There would be an error that is more than a\nmistake—a special form of error which remains unchangeable, eternal, and\nbeyond correction or escape. There would be one mistake which had the\npower to undo creation and to make a world which could replace it and\ndestroy the Will of God. Only if this were possible could there be some\nappearances which could withstand the miracle and not be healed by it.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> There is no surer proof idolatry is what you wish than a belief there\nare some forms of sickness and of joylessness forgiveness cannot heal.\nThis means that you prefer to keep some idols and are not prepared as\nyet to let all idols go. And thus you think that some appearances are\nreal and not appearances at all. Be not deceived about the meaning of a\nfixed belief that some appearances are harder to look past than others\nare. It <em>always</em> means you think forgiveness must be limited. And you\nhave set a goal of partial pardon and a limited escape from guilt for\n<em>you</em>. What can this be except a false forgiveness of yourself and\neveryone who seems apart from you?</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> It must be true the miracle can heal <em>all</em> forms of sickness, or it\ncannot heal. Its purpose cannot be to judge which forms are real and\nwhich appearances are true. If one appearance must remain apart from\nhealing, one illusion must be part of truth. And you could not escape\nall guilt, but only some of it. You must forgive God’s Son <em>entirely.</em>\nOr you will keep an image of yourself that is not whole and will remain\nafraid to look within and find escape from every idol there. Salvation\nrests on faith there <em>cannot</em> be some forms of guilt which you cannot\nforgive. And so there cannot be appearances which have replaced the\ntruth about God’s Son.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> Look on your brother with the willingness to see him as he is. And do\nnot keep a part of him outside your willingness that he be healed. To\nheal is to make whole. And what is whole can have no missing parts that\nhave been kept outside. Forgiveness rests on recognizing this and being\nglad there cannot be some forms of sickness which the miracle must lack\nthe power to heal.</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> God’s Son is perfect, or he cannot <em>be</em> God’s Son. Nor will you know\nhim if you think he does not merit the escape from guilt in <em>all</em> its\nforms and <em>all</em> its consequence. There is no way to think of him but\nthis if you would know the truth about yourself:</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> <em>I thank you, Father, for your perfect Son,<br />\nAnd in his glory will I see my own</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> Here is the joyful statement that there are no forms of evil which\ncan overcome the Will of God—the glad acknowledgment that guilt has not\nsucceeded by your wish to make illusions real. And what is this except a\nsimple statement of the truth?</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> Look on your brother with this hope in you, and you will understand\nhe could not make an error that could change the truth in him. It is not\ndifficult to overlook mistakes that have been given no effects. But what\nyou see as having power to make an idol of the Son of God you will <em>not</em>\npardon. For he has become to you a graven image and a sign of death. Is\n<em>this</em> your savior? Is his Father wrong about His Son? Or have <em>you</em>\nbeen deceived in him who has been given you to heal, for <em>your</em>\nsalvation and deliverance?</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>82</sup> Would God have left the meaning of the world to your interpretation?\nIf He had, it <em>has</em> no meaning. For it cannot be that meaning changes\nconstantly and yet is true. The Holy Spirit looks upon the world as with\none purpose, changelessly established. And no situation can affect its\naim but must be in accord with it. For only if its aim could change with\nevery situation could each one be open to interpretation which is\ndifferent every time you think of it. You add an element into the script\nyou write for every minute in the day, and all that happens now means\nsomething else. You take away another element, and every meaning shifts\naccordingly.</p>\n\n<p><sup>83</sup> What do your scripts reflect except your plans for what the day\n<em>should</em> be? And thus you judge disaster and success, advance, retreat,\nand gain and loss. These judgments all are made according to the roles\nthe script assigns. The fact they have no meaning in themselves is\ndemonstrated by the ease with which these labels change with other\njudgments made on different aspects of experience. And then in looking\nback you think you see another meaning in what went before. What have\nyou really done except to show there <em>was</em> no meaning there? But you\nassigned a meaning in the light of goals that change, with every meaning\nshifting as they change.</p>\n\n<p><sup>84</sup> Only a constant purpose can endow events with stable meaning. But it\nmust accord <em>one</em> meaning to them all. If they are given different\nmeanings, it must be that they reflect but different purposes. And this\nis all the meaning that they have. Can this <em>be</em> meaning? Can confusion\nbe what meaning means? Perception cannot be in constant flux and make\nallowance for stability of meaning anywhere. Fear is a judgment never\njustified. Its presence has no meaning but to show you wrote a fearful\nscript and are afraid accordingly. But not because the thing you fear\nhas fearful meaning in itself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>85</sup> A common <em>purpose</em> is the only means whereby perception can be\nstabilized and one interpretation given to the world and all experiences\nhere. In this shared purpose is one [meaning] shared by everyone and\neverything you see. You do not have to judge, for you have learned one\nmeaning has been given everything, and you are glad to see it\neverywhere. It cannot change <em>because</em> you would perceive it everywhere,\nunchanged by circumstance. And so you <em>offer</em> it to all events, and let\nthem offer you stability.</p>\n\n<p><sup>86</sup> Escape from judgment simply lies in this—all things have but one\npurpose which you share with all the world. And nothing in the world can\nbe opposed to it, for it belongs to everything as it belongs to you. In\nsingle purpose is the end of all ideas of sacrifice, which must assume a\ndifferent purpose for the one who gains and him who loses. There could\nbe no thought of sacrifice apart from this idea. And it is this idea of\ndifferent goals which makes perception shift and meaning change. In one\nunited goal does this become impossible, for your agreement makes\ninterpretation stabilize and last.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> How can communication really be established while the symbols which\nare used mean different things? The Holy Spirit’s goal gives one\ninterpretation, meaningful to you and to your brother. Thus can you\ncommunicate with him and he with you. In symbols which you both can\nunderstand, the sacrifice of meaning is undone. All sacrifice entails\nthe loss of your ability to see relationships among events. And looked\nat separately, they <em>have</em> no meaning. For there is no light by which\nthey can be seen and understood. They have no purpose. And what they are\nfor cannot be seen. In any thought of loss, there <em>is</em> no meaning. No\none has agreed with you on what it means. It is a part of a distorted\nscript which cannot be interpreted with meaning. It must be forever\nunintelligible. This is not communication. Your dark dreams are but the\nsenseless, isolated scripts you write in sleep. Look not to separate\ndreams for meaning. Only dreams of pardon can be shared. They mean the\nsame to both of you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> Do not interpret out of solitude, for what you see means nothing. It\nwill shift in what it stands for, and you will believe the world is an\nuncertain place in which you walk in danger and uncertainty. It is but\nyour <em>interpretations</em> which are lacking in stability, for they are not\nin line with what you really are. This is a state so seemingly unsafe\nthat fear <em>must</em> rise. Do not continue thus, my brothers. We have <em>one</em>\nInterpreter. And through His use of symbols are we joined so that they\nmean the same to all of us. Our common language lets us speak to all our\nbrothers and to understand with them forgiveness has been given to us\nall, and thus we can communicate again.</p>\n\n",

For everything you see will change, and yet you thought\nit real before, and now you think it real again. Reality is thus reduced\nto form and capable of change. Reality is changeless. It is this that\nmakes it real and keeps it separate from <em>all</em> appearances. It must\ntranscend all form to be itself. It <em>cannot</em> change.</p>\n\n<p><sup>90</sup> The miracle is means to demonstrate that all appearances can change\nbecause they <em>are</em> appearances and cannot have the changelessness\nreality entails. The miracle attests salvation from appearances by\n<em>showing</em> they can change. Your brother has a changelessness in him\nbeyond appearance and deception both. It is obscured by changing views\nof him which you <em>perceive</em> as his reality. The happy dream about him\ntakes the form of the appearance of his perfect health, his perfect\nfreedom from all forms of lack, and safety from disaster of all kinds.\nThe miracle is proof he is not bound by loss or suffering in any form\nbecause it can so easily be <em>changed.</em> This demonstrates that it was\n<em>never</em> real and could not stem from his reality. For that is changeless\nand has no effects which anything in Heaven or on earth could ever\nalter. But appearances are shown to be unreal <em>because</em> they change.</p>\n\n<p><sup>91</sup> What is temptation but a wish to make illusions real? It does not\nseem to be the wish that no reality be so. Yet it is an assertion that\nsome forms of idols have a powerful appeal which makes them harder to\nresist than those you would not <em>want</em> to have reality. Temptation,\nthen, is nothing more than this—a prayer the miracle touch not some\ndreams but keep their unreality obscure and give to them reality\ninstead. And Heaven gives no answer to the prayer, nor can a miracle be\ngiven you to heal appearances you do not like. You have established\n<em>limits</em>. What you ask <em>is</em> given you, but not of God Who knows no\nlimits. You have limited <em>yourself.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>92</sup> Reality is changeless. Miracles but show what you have interposed\nbetween reality and your awareness is unreal and does not interfere at\nall. The cost of the belief there must be some appearances beyond the\nhope of change is that the miracle cannot come forth from you\nconsistently. For you have <em>asked</em> it be withheld from power to heal all\ndreams. There is no miracle you cannot have when you <em>desire</em> healing.\nBut there is no miracle that can be given you unless you want it. Choose\nwhat you would heal, and He Who gives all miracles has not been given\nfreedom to bestow His gifts upon God’s Son. When he is tempted, he\ndenies reality. And he becomes the willing slave of what he chose\ninstead.</p>\n\n<p><sup>93</sup> <em>Because</em> reality is changeless is a miracle already there to heal\nall things that change and offer them to you to see in happy form,\ndevoid of fear. It will be given you to look upon your brother thus. But\nnot while you would have it otherwise in some respects. For this but\nmeans you would not have him healed and whole. The Christ in him is\nperfect. Is it this that you would look upon? Then let there be no\ndreams about him which you would prefer to seeing this. And you will see\nthe Christ in him because you <em>let</em> Him come to you. And when He has\nappeared to you, you will be certain you are like Him, for He is the\nchangeless in your brother <em>and</em> in you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>94</sup> This will you look upon when you decide there is not one appearance\nyou would hold in place of what your brother really is. Let no\ntemptation to prefer a dream allow uncertainty to enter here. Be not\nmade guilty and afraid when you are tempted by a dream of what he is.\nBut do not give it power to replace the changeless in him in your sight\nof him. There is no false appearance but will fade if you request a\nmiracle instead. There is no pain from which he is not free if you would\nhave him be but what he is.

Can this be hard to learn by anyone who\n<em>wants</em> it to be true? Only unwillingness to learn it could make such an\neasy lesson difficult. How hard is it to see that what is false cannot\nbe true, and what is true cannot be false? You can no longer say that\nyou perceive no differences in false and true. You have been told\nexactly how to tell one from the other and just what to do if you become\nconfused. Why then do you persist in learning not such simple things?</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> There <em>is</em> a reason. But confuse it not with difficulty in the simple\nthings salvation asks you learn. It teaches but the very obvious. It\nmerely goes from one apparent lesson to the next in easy steps which\nlead you gently from one to another with no strain at all. This cannot\nbe confusing, yet you <em>are</em> confused. For somehow you believe that what\nis totally confused is easier to learn and understand. What you have\ntaught yourselves is such a giant learning feat it is indeed incredible.\nBut you accomplished it because you wanted to and did not pause in\ndiligence to judge it hard to learn, or too complex to grasp.</p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup> No one who understands what you have learned, how carefully you have\nlearned it, and the pains to which you went to practice and repeat the\nlessons endlessly in every form you could conceive of them could ever\ndoubt the power of your learning skill. There is no greater power in the\nworld. The world was made by it and even now depends on nothing else.\nThe lessons you have taught yourselves have been so overlearned and\nfixed they rise like heavy curtains to obscure the simple and the\nobvious. Say not you cannot learn <em>them</em>. For your power to learn is\nstrong enough to teach you that your will is not your own, your thoughts\ndo not belong to you, and even you are someone else.</p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup> Who could maintain that lessons such as these are easy? Yet you have\nlearned more than this. You have continued, taking every step, however\ndifficult, without complaint until a world was built that suited you.\nAnd every lesson that makes up the world arises from the first\naccomplishment of learning—an enormity so great the Holy Spirit’s Voice\nseems small and still before its magnitude. The world began with one\nstrange lesson, powerful enough to render God forgotten and His Son an\nalien to himself, in exile from the home where God Himself established\nhim. You who have taught yourselves the Son of God is guilty, say not\nthat you cannot learn the simple things salvation teaches you!</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> Learning is an ability you made and gave yourselves. It was not made\nto do the Will of God but to uphold a wish that It could be opposed, and\nthat a will apart from It was yet more real than It. And this has\nlearning sought to demonstrate, and you have learned what it was made to\nteach. Now does your ancient overlearning stand implacable before the\nVoice of truth and teach you that Its lessons are not true, too hard to\nlearn, too difficult to see, and too opposed to what is really true. Yet\nyou <em>will</em> learn them, for their learning is the only purpose for your\nlearning skill the Holy Spirit sees in all the world. His simple lessons\nin forgiveness have a power mightier than yours because they call from\nGod and from your Self to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> Is this a <em>little</em> Voice, so small and still It cannot rise above the\nsenseless noise of sounds which have no meaning? God willed not His Son\nforget Him. And the power of His Will is in the Voice that speaks for\nHim. Which lesson will you learn? What outcome is inevitable, sure as\nGod, and far beyond all doubt and question? Can it be your little\nlearning, strange in outcome and incredible in difficulty, will\nwithstand the simple lessons being taught to you in every moment of each\nday, since time began and learning had been made?</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> The lessons to be learned are only two. Each has its outcome in a\ndifferent world. And each world follows surely from its source. The\ncertain outcome of the lesson that God’s Son is guilty is the world you\nsee. It <em>is</em> a world of terror and despair. Nor is there hope of\nhappiness in it. There is no plan for safety you can make that ever will\nsucceed. There is no joy that you can seek for here and hope to find.\nYet this is not the only outcome which your learning can produce.\nHowever much you may have overlearned your chosen task, the lesson which\nreflects the love of God is stronger still. And you <em>will</em> learn God’s\nSon is innocent and see another world.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> The outcome of the lesson that God’s Son is guiltless is a world in\nwhich there is no fear and everything is lit with hope and sparkles with\na gentle friendliness. Nothing but calls to you in soft appeal to be\nyour friend and let it join with you. And never does a call remain\nunheard, misunderstood, nor left unanswered in the selfsame tongue in\nwhich the call was made. And you will understand it was this call that\neveryone and everything within the world has <em>always</em> made, but you had\nnot perceived it as it was. And now you see you were mistaken. You had\nbeen deceived by forms the call was hidden in. And so you did not hear\nit and had lost a friend who always wanted to be part of you. The soft,\neternal calling of each part of God’s creation to the whole is heard\nthroughout the world this second lesson brings.</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> There is no living thing which does not share the universal will that\nit be whole and that you do not leave its call unheard. Without your\nanswer is it left to die, as it is saved from death when you have heard\nits calling as the ancient call to life and understood that it is but\nyour own. The Christ in you remembers God with all the certainty with\nwhich He knows His love. But only if His Son is innocent can He be Love.\nFor God were fear indeed if he whom He created innocent could be a slave\nto guilt. God’s perfect Son remembers his creation. But in guilt he has\nforgotten what he really is.</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> The fear of God results as surely from the lesson that His Son is\nguilty as God’s love must be remembered when he learns his innocence.\nFor hate must father fear and look upon its father as itself. How wrong\nare you who fail to hear the call that echoes past each seeming call to\ndeath, that sings behind each murderous attack and pleads that love\nrestore the dying world! You do not understand Who calls to you beyond\neach form of hate, each call to war. Yet you will recognize Him as you\ngive Him answer in the language that He calls. He will appear when you\nhave answered Him, and you will know in Him that God <em>is</em> Love.</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> What is temptation but a wish to make the wrong decision on what you\nwould learn and have an outcome that you do not want? It is the\nrecognition that it is a state of mind unwanted that becomes the means\nwhereby the choice is reassessed; another outcome seen to be preferred.\nYou are deceived if you believe you want disaster and disunity and pain.\nHear not the call for this within yourself. But listen, rather, to the\ndeeper call beyond it that appeals for peace and joy. And all the world\nwill <em>give</em> you joy and peace. For as you hear, you answer. And behold!\nYour answer is the proof of what you learned. Its outcome is the world\nyou look upon.</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> Let us be still an instant and forget all things we ever learned, all\nthoughts we had, and every preconception which we hold of what things\nmean and what their purpose is. Let us remember not our own ideas of\nwhat the world is for. We do not know. Let every image held of\n[anyone] be loosened from our minds and swept away. Be innocent of\njudgment, unaware of any thoughts of evil or of good that ever crossed\nyour mind of anyone. Now do [you] know him not. But you <em>are</em> free to\nlearn of him and learn of him anew. Now is he born again to you, and you\nare born again to him without the past that sentenced him to die, and\nyou with him. Now is he free to live, as you are free because an ancient\nlearning passed away and left a place for truth to be reborn.</p>\n\n",

Who could be hurt in such a war unless he hurts\nhimself? He has no enemy in truth. And can he be assailed by dreams?</p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup> Let us review again what seems to stand between you and the truth of\nwhat you are. For there are steps in its relinquishment. The first is a\ndecision that <em>you</em> make. But afterwards the truth is <em>given</em> you. You\nwould <em>establish</em> truth. And by your wish, you set two choices to be\nmade each time you think you must decide on anything. Neither is true.\nNor are they different. Yet must we see them both before you can look\npast them to the one alternative that <em>is</em> a different choice. But not\nin dreams you made that this might be obscured to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup> What <em>you</em> would choose between is not a choice and gives but the\nillusion it is free, for it will have one outcome either way. Thus is it\nreally not a choice at all. The leader and the follower emerge as\nseparate roles, each seeming to possess advantages you would not want to\nlose. So in their fusion there appears to be the hope of satisfaction\nand of peace. You see yourself divided into both these roles, forever\nsplit between the two. And every friend or enemy becomes a means to help\nyou save yourself from this.</p>\n\n<p><sup>16</sup> Perhaps you call it love. Perhaps you think that it is murder\njustified at last. You hate the one you gave the leader’s role when you\nwould have it, and you hate as well his not assuming it at times you\nwant to let the follower in you arise and give away the role of\nleadership. And this is what you made your brother <em>for</em> and learned to\nthink that this his purpose <em>is</em>. Unless he serves it, he has not\nfulfilled the function that was given him by you. And thus he merits\ndeath because he has no purpose and no usefulness to you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>17</sup> And what of him? What does he want of you? What could he want, but\nwhat you want of him? Herein is life as easily as death, for what you\nchoose, you choose as well for him. Two calls you make to him, as he to\nyou. Between <em>these</em> two <em>is</em> choice because from them there <em>is</em> a\ndifferent outcome. If he be the leader or the follower to you, it\nmatters not, for you have chosen death. But if he calls for death or\ncalls for life, for hate or for forgiveness and for help, is not the\nsame in outcome. Hear the one, and you are separate from him and are\nlost. But hear the other, and you join with him, and in your answer is\nsalvation found. The voice you hear in him is but your own. What does he\nask you for? And listen well! For he is asking what will come to you\nbecause you see an image of <em>yourself</em> and hear <em>your</em> voice requesting\nwhat you <em>want.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>18</sup> Before you answer, pause to think of this:</p>\n\n<p><sup>19</sup> <em>The answer that I give my brother is what I am asking for. And what\nI learn of him is what I learn about myself</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>20</sup> Then let us wait an instant and be still, forgetting everything we\nthought we heard; remembering how much we do not know. This brother\nneither leads nor follows us but walks beside us on the selfsame road.\nHe is like us, as near or far away from what we want as we will let him\nbe. We make no gains he does not make with us, and we fall back if he\ndoes not advance.  Take not his hand in anger but in love, for in his\nprogress do you count your own. And we go separately along the way\nunless you keep him safely by your side.</p>\n\n<p><sup>21</sup> Because he is your equal in God’s love, you will be saved from all\nappearances and answer to the Christ Who calls to you. Be still and\nlisten. Think not ancient thoughts. Forget the dismal lessons that you\nlearned about this Son of God who calls to you. Christ calls to all with\nequal tenderness, seeing no leaders and no followers and hearing but one\nanswer to them all. Because He hears one Voice, He cannot hear a\ndifferent answer from the one He gave when God appointed Him His only\nSon.</p>\n\n<p><sup>22</sup> Be very still an instant. Come without all thought of what you ever\nlearned before and put aside all images you made. The old will fall away\nbefore the new without your opposition or intent. There will be no\nattack upon the things you thought were precious and in need of care.\nThere will be no assault upon your wish to hear a call that never has\nbeen made. Nothing will hurt you in this holy place to which you come to\nlisten silently and learn the truth of what you really want. No more\nthan this will you be asked to learn. But as you hear it, you will\nunderstand you need but come away without the thoughts you did not want\nand that were never true.</p>\n\n<p><sup>23</sup> Forgive your brother all appearances, which are but ancient lessons\nthat you taught yourself about the sinfulness in <em>you</em>. Hear but his\ncall for mercy and release from all the fearful images he holds of what\nhe is and of what you must be. He is afraid to walk with you and thinks\nperhaps a bit behind, a bit ahead, would be a safer place for him to be.\nCan <em>you</em> make progress if you think the same, advancing only when he\nwould step back and falling back when he would go ahead? For so do you\nforget the journey’s goal, which is but to decide to walk <em>with</em> him, so\nneither leads nor follows. Thus it is a way you go <em>together</em>, not\nalone. And in this choice is learning’s outcome changed, for Christ has\nbeen reborn to both of you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>24</sup> An instant spent without your old ideas of who your great companion\nis and what he <em>should</em> be asking for will be enough to let this happen.\nAnd you will perceive his purpose is the same as yours. He asks for what\n<em>you</em> want and needs the same as <em>you</em>. It takes perhaps a different\nform in him, but it is not the form you answer to. He asks and you\nreceive, for you have come with but one purpose—that you both may learn\nyou love each other with a brother’s love. And as a brother, must his\nFather be the same as yours, as he is like yourself.</p>\n\n<p><sup>25</sup> Together is your joint inheritance remembered and accepted by you\nboth. Alone it is denied to both of you. Is it not clear that while you\nstill insist on leading or on following, you think you walk alone with\nno one by your side? This is the road to nowhere, for the light cannot\nbe given while you walk alone, and so you cannot see which way you go.\nAnd thus there is confusion and a sense of endless doubting as you\nstagger back and forward in the darkness and alone. Yet these are but\nappearances of what the journey is and how it must be made. For next to\nyou is One Who holds the light before you so that every step is made in\ncertainty and sureness of the road. A blindfold can indeed obscure your\nsight but cannot make the way itself grow dark. And He Who travels with\nyou <em>has</em> the light.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>26</sup> Only the self-accused condemn. As you prepare to make a choice that\nwill result in different outcomes, there is first one thing that must be\noverlearned. It must become a habit of response so typical of everything\nyou do that it becomes your first response to all temptation and to\nevery situation that occurs. Learn this and learn it well, for it is\nhere delay of happiness is shortened by a span of time you cannot\nrealize. You never hate your brother for his sins, but <em>only</em> for your\nown. Whatever form his sins appear to take, it but obscures the fact\nthat you believe them to be yours and therefore meriting a “just”\nattack.</p>\n\n<p><sup>27</sup> Why should his sins <em>be</em> sins if you did not believe they could not\nbe forgiven in you? Why are they real in him if you did not believe that\nthey are your reality? And why do you attack them everywhere, except you\nhate yourself? Are <em>you</em> a sin? You answer “yes” whenever you attack,\nfor by attack do you assert that you are guilty and must give as you\ndeserve. And what can you deserve but what you <em>are</em>? If you did not\nbelieve that you deserved attack, it never would occur to you to <em>give</em>\nattack to anyone at all. Why should you? What would be the gain to you?\nWhat could the outcome be that you would <em>want</em>? And how <em>could</em> murder\nbring you benefit?</p>\n\n<p><sup>28</sup> Sins are in bodies. They are not perceived in minds. They are not\nseen as purposes but actions. Bodies act, and minds do not. And\ntherefore must the body be at fault for what it does. It is not seen to\nbe a passive thing, obeying your commands and doing nothing of itself at\nall. If you are sin you <em>are</em> a body, for the mind acts not. And purpose\nmust be in the body, not the mind. The body must act on its own and\nmotivate itself. If you are sin, you lock the mind within the body, and\nyou give its purpose to its prison-house, which acts instead of it. A\njailer does not follow orders, but <em>enforces</em> orders on the prisoner.</p>\n\n<p><sup>29</sup> Yet is the <em>body</em> prisoner and <em>not</em> the mind. The body thinks no\nthoughts. It has no power to learn, to pardon, nor enslave. It gives no\norders that the mind need serve nor sets conditions that it must obey.\nIt holds in prison but the willing mind that would abide in it. It\nsickens at the bidding of the mind that would become its prisoner. And\nit grows old and dies because that mind is sick within itself. Learning\nis all that causes change. And so the body, where no learning can occur,\ncould never change unless the mind preferred the body change in its\nappearances to suit the purpose given by the mind. For it <em>can</em> learn,\nand <em>there</em> is all change made.</p>\n\n<p><sup>30</sup> The mind that thinks it is a sin has but one purpose—that the body be\nthe source of sin and keep it in the prison-house it chose and guard and\nhold itself at bay, a sleeping prisoner to the snarling dogs of hate and\nevil, sickness and attack, of pain and age, of grief and suffering. Here\nare the thoughts of sacrifice preserved, for here guilt rules and orders\nthat the world be like itself—a place where nothing can find mercy or\nsurvive the ravages of fear except in murder and in death. For here are\nyou made sin, and sin cannot abide the joyous and the free, for they are\nenemies which sin must kill. In death is sin preserved, and those who\nthink that they are sin must die for what they think they are.</p>\n\n<p><sup>31</sup> Let us be glad that you <em>will</em> see what you believe, and that it has\nbeen given you to <em>change</em> what you believe. The body will but follow.\nIt can never lead you where you would not be. It does not guard your\nsleep nor interfere with your awakening. Release your body from\nimprisonment, and you will see no one as prisoner to what you have\nescaped. You will not want to hold in guilt your chosen enemies nor keep\nin chains to the illusion of a changing love the ones you think are\nfriends.</p>\n\n<p><sup>32</sup> The innocent release in gratitude for <em>their</em> release. And what they\nsee upholds their freedom from imprisonment and death. Open your mind to\nchange, and there will be no ancient penalty exacted from your brother\n<em>or</em> yourself. For God has said there <em>is</em> no sacrifice that can be\nasked; there <em>is</em> no sacrifice that can be made.</p>\n\n",

Why should this be?\nBecause it is a place where choice among illusions seems to be the\n<em>only</em> choice. And you are in control of outcomes of your choosing. Thus\nyou think within the narrow band from birth to death a little time is\ngiven you to use for you alone, a time when everyone conflicts with you,\nbut you can choose which road will lead you out of conflict and away\nfrom difficulties which concern you not. Yet they <em>are</em> your concern.\nHow then can you escape from them by leaving them behind? What must go\nwith you, you will take with you whatever road you choose to walk along.</p>\n\n<p><sup>34</sup> <em>Real</em> choice is no illusion. But the world has none to offer. All\nits roads but lead to disappointment, nothingness, and death. There <em>is</em>\nno choice in its alternatives. Seek not escape from problems here. The\nworld was made that problems could not <em>be</em> escaped. Be not deceived by\nall the different names its roads are given. They have but one end. And\neach is but the means to gain that end, for it is here that all its\nroads will lead, however differently they seem to start, however\ndifferently they seem to go. Their end is certain, for there is no\nchoice among them. All of them will lead to death. On some you travel\ngaily for a while before the bleakness enters. And on some the thorns\nare felt at once. The choice is not <em>what</em> will the ending be but <em>when</em>\nit comes.</p>\n\n<p><sup>35</sup> There is no choice where every end is sure. Perhaps you would prefer\nto try them all before you really learn they are but one. The roads this\nworld can offer seem to be quite large in number, but the time must come\nwhen everyone begins to see how like they are to one another. Men have\ndied on seeing this because they saw no way except the pathways offered\nby the world. And learning they led nowhere, lost their hope. And yet\nthis was the time they could have learned their greatest lesson. All\nmust reach this point and go beyond it. It is true indeed there is no\nchoice at all within the world. But this is not the lesson in itself.\nThe lesson has a purpose, and in <em>this</em> you come to understand what it\nis <em>for</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>36</sup> Why would you seek to try another road, another person, or another\nplace when you have learned the way the lesson starts but do not yet\nperceive what it is for? Its purpose is the <em>answer</em> to the search that\nall must undertake who still believe there is another answer to be\nfound. Learn now, without despair, there is no hope of answer in the\nworld. But do not judge the lesson which is but <em>begun</em> with this. Seek\nnot another signpost in the world which seems to point to still another\nroad. No longer look for hope where there is none. Make fast your\nlearning <em>now</em>, and understand you but waste time unless you go beyond\nwhat you have learned to what is yet to learn. For from this lowest\npoint will learning lead to heights of happiness in which you see the\npurpose of the lesson shining clear, and perfectly within your learning\ngrasp.</p>\n\n<p><sup>37</sup> Who would be willing to be turned away from all the roadways of the\nworld unless he understood their real futility? Is it not needful that\nhe should begin with this, to seek another way instead? For while he\nsees a choice where there is none, what power of decision can he use?\nThe great release of power must begin with learning where it really has\na <em>use</em>. And what decision has power if it be applied in situations\nwithout choice?</p>\n\n<p><sup>38</sup> The learning that the world can offer but one choice, no matter what\nits form may be, is the beginning of acceptance that there is a <em>real</em>\nalternative instead. To fight against this step is to defeat your\npurpose here. You did not come to learn to find a road the world does\nnot contain. The search for different pathways in the world is but the\nsearch for different forms of truth. And this would <em>keep</em> the truth\nfrom being reached.</p>\n\n<p><sup>39</sup> Think not that happiness is ever found by following a road <em>away</em>\nfrom it. This makes no sense and <em>cannot</em> be the way. To you who seem to\nfind this course to be too difficult to learn, let me repeat that to\nachieve a goal you must proceed in its direction, <em>not</em> away from it.\nAnd every road that leads the other way will not advance the purpose to\nbe found. If <em>this</em> be difficult to understand, then <em>is</em> this course\nimpossible to learn. But only then. For otherwise, it is a simple\nteaching in the obvious.</p>\n\n<p><sup>40</sup> There <em>is</em> a choice which you have power to make when you have seen\nthe real alternatives. Until that point is reached, you <em>have</em> no\nchoice, and you can but decide how you would choose the better to\ndeceive yourself again. This course attempts to teach no more than that\nthe power of decision cannot lie in choosing different forms of what is\nstill the <em>same</em> illusion and the <em>same</em> mistake. All choices in the\nworld depend on this—you choose between your brother and yourself, and\nyou will gain as much as he will lose, and what you lose is what is\ngiven him. How utterly opposed to truth is this, when the lesson’s\npurpose is to teach that what your brother loses <em>you</em> have lost and\nwhat he gains is what is given <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>41</sup> He has not left His Thoughts! But you forgot His Presence and\nremembered not His Love. No pathway in the world can lead to Him, nor\nany worldly goal is one with His. What road in all the world will lead\nwithin, when every road was made to separate the journey from the\npurpose it <em>must</em> have unless it be but futile wandering? All roads that\nlead away from what you are will lead you to confusion and despair. Yet\nhas He never left His Thoughts to die, without their Source forever in\nthemselves. He has not left His Thoughts! He could no more depart from\nthem than they could keep Him out. In unity with Him do they abide, and\nin their Oneness both are kept complete.</p>\n\n<p><sup>42</sup> There <em>is</em> no road that leads away from Him. A journey from\n<em>yourself</em> does not exist. How foolish and insane it is to think that\nthere could be a road with such an aim! Where could it go? And how could\nyou be made to travel on it, walking there without your own reality at\none with you? Forgive yourself your madness and forget all senseless\njourneys and all goal-less aims. They have no meaning. You can not\nescape from what you are. For God <em>is</em> merciful and did not let His Son\nabandon Him. For what He is, be thankful, for in that is your escape\nfrom madness and from death. Nowhere but where He is can <em>you</em> be found.\nThere <em>is</em> no path that does not lead to Him.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>43</sup> The learning of the world is built upon a concept of the self\nadjusted to the world’s reality. It fits it well. For this an image is\nthat suits a world of shadows and illusions. Here it walks at home,\nwhere what it sees is one with it. The building of a concept of the self\nis what the learning of the world is <em>for</em>. This is its purpose—that you\ncome without a self and make one as you go along. And by the time you\nreach “maturity,” you have perfected it to meet the world on equal\nterms, at one with its demands.</p>\n\n<p><sup>44</sup> A <em>concept</em> of the self is made by <em>you</em>. It bears no likeness to\nyourself at all. It is an idol, made to take the place of your reality\nas Son of God. The concept of the self the world would teach is not the\nthing that it appears to be. For it is made to serve two purposes, but\none of which the mind can recognize. The first presents the face of\ninnocence, the aspect acted <em>on</em>. It is this face that smiles and charms\nand even seems to love. It searches for companions, and it looks at\ntimes with pity on the suffering and sometimes offers solace. It\nbelieves that it is good within an evil world.</p>\n\n<p><sup>45</sup> This aspect can grow angry, for the world is wicked and unable to\nprovide the love and shelter innocence deserves. And so this face is\noften wet with tears at the injustices the world accords to those who\nwould be generous and good. This aspect never makes the first attack.\nBut every day a hundred little things make small assaults upon its\ninnocence, provoking it to irritation and at last to open insult and\nabuse.</p>\n\n<p><sup>46</sup> The face of innocence the concept of the self so proudly wears can\ntolerate attack in self-defense, for is it not a well-known fact the\nworld deals harshly with defenseless innocence? No one who makes a\npicture of himself omits this face, for he has need of it. The other\nside he does not <em>want</em> to see. Yet it is here the learning of the world\nhas set its sights, for it is here the world’s “reality” is set to see\nto it the idol lasts.</p>\n\n<p><sup>47</sup> Beneath the face of innocence there is a lesson that the concept of\nthe self was made to teach. It is a lesson in a terrible displacement\nand a fear so devastating that the face which smiles above it must\nforever look away, lest it perceive the treachery it hides. The lesson\nteaches this: “I am the thing you made of me, and as you look on me, you\nstand condemned because of what I am.” On this conception of the self\nthe world smiles with approval, for it guarantees the pathways of the\nworld are safely kept and those who walk on them will not escape.</p>\n\n<p><sup>48</sup> Here is the central lesson that ensures your brother is condemned\neternally. For what you are has now become <em>his</em> sin. For this is no\nforgiveness possible. No longer does it matter what he does, for your\naccusing finger points to him, unwavering and deadly in its aim. It\npoints to you as well, but this is kept still deeper in the mists below\nthe face of innocence. And in these shrouded vaults are all his sins and\nyours preserved and kept in darkness where they cannot be perceived as\nerrors, which the light would surely show. You can be neither blamed for\nwhat you are, nor can you change the things it makes you do. And you are\neach the symbol of your sins to one another, silently, and yet with\nceaseless urgency condemning still your brother for the hated thing you\nare.</p>\n\n<p><sup>49</sup> Concepts are learned. They are not natural. Apart from learning, they\ndo not exist. They are not given, and they must be made. Not one of them\nis true, and many come from feverish imaginations, hot with hatred and\ndistortions born of fear. What is a concept but a thought to which its\nmaker gives a meaning of his own? Concepts maintain the world. But they\ncannot be used to demonstrate the world is real. For all of them are\nmade within the world, born in its shadow, growing in its ways, and\nfinally “maturing” in its thought. They are ideas of idols painted with\nthe brushes of the world, which cannot make a single picture\nrepresenting truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>50</sup> A concept of the self is meaningless, for no one here can see what it\nis <em>for</em> and therefore cannot picture what it <em>is</em>. Yet is all learning\nwhich the world directs begun and ended with the single aim of teaching\nyou this concept of yourself, that you will choose to follow this\nworld’s laws and never seek to go beyond its roads nor realize the way\nyou see yourself. Now must the Holy Spirit find a way to help you see\nthis concept of the self must be undone if any peace of mind is to be\ngiven you. Nor can it be unlearned except by lessons aimed to teach that\nyou are something <em>else</em>. For otherwise you would be asked to make\nexchange of what you now believe for total loss of self, and greater\nterror would arise in you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>51</sup> Thus are the Holy Spirit’s lesson plans arranged in easy steps that\nthough there be some lack of ease at times and some distress, there is\nno shattering of what was learned, but just a re-translation of what\nseems to be the evidence on its behalf. Let us consider then what proof\nthere is that you are what your brother made of you. For even though you\ndo not yet perceive that this is what you think, you surely learned by\nnow that you <em>behave</em> as if it were. Does <em>he</em> react for <em>you</em>? And did\nhe know exactly what would happen? Could he see your future and ordain\nbefore it came what you should do in every circumstance? He must have\nmade the world as well as you to have such prescience in the things to\ncome.</p>\n\n<p><sup>52</sup> That you are what your brother made of you seems most unlikely. Even\nif he did, who gave the face of innocence to you? Is this <em>your</em>\ncontribution? Who is, then, the “you” who made it? And who is deceived\nby all your goodness and attacks it so? Let us forget the concept’s\nfoolishness and merely think of this—there are two parts to what you\nthink yourself to be. If one was generated by your brother, who was\nthere to make the other? And from whom must something be kept hidden? If\nthe world be evil, there is still no need to hide what <em>you</em> are made\nof. Who is there to see? And what but is attacked could <em>need</em> defense?</p>\n\n<p><sup>53</sup> Perhaps the reason why this concept must be kept in darkness is that\nin the light the one who would not think it true is <em>you</em>. And what\nwould happen to the world you know if all its underpinnings were\nremoved? Your concept of the world <em>depends</em> upon this concept of the\nself. And both would go if either one were ever raised to doubt. The\nHoly Spirit does not seek to throw you into panic. So He merely asks if\njust a <em>little</em> question might be raised.</p>\n\n<p><sup>54</sup> There are alternatives about the thing that you must be. You might\nfor instance be the thing you chose to have your <em>brother</em> be. This\nshifts the concept of the self from what is wholly passive and at least\nmakes way for active choice and some acknowledgment that interaction\nmust have entered in. There is some understanding that you chose for\nboth of you, and what he represents has meaning that was given it by\nyou. It also shows some glimmering of sight into perception’s law that\nwhat you see reflects the state of [the] <em>perceiver’s</em> mind. Yet who\nwas it that did the choosing first? If you are what you chose your\nbrother be, alternatives were there to choose among, and someone must\nhave first decided on the one to choose and let the others go.</p>\n\n<p><sup>55</sup> Although this step has gains, it does not yet approach a basic\nquestion. Something must have gone <em>before</em> these concepts of the self.\nAnd something must have done the learning which gave rise to them. Nor\ncan this be explained by either view. The main advantage of the shifting\nto the second from the first is that <em>you</em> somehow entered in the choice\nby your decision. But this gain is paid in almost equal loss, for now\n<em>you</em> stand accused of guilt for what your brother is. And you must\nshare his guilt because you chose it for him in the image of your own.\nWhile only he was treacherous before, now must you be condemned along\nwith him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>56</sup> The concept of the self has always been the great preoccupation of\nthe world. And everyone believes that he must find the answer to the\nriddle of himself. Salvation can be seen as nothing more than the\n<em>escape</em> from concepts. It does not concern itself with content of the\nmind, but with the simple statement that it <em>thinks</em>. And what can think\nhas choice and <em>can</em> be shown that different thoughts have different\nconsequence. So it can learn that everything it thinks reflects the deep\nconfusion that it feels about how it was made and what it is. And\nvaguely does the concept of the self appear to answer what it does not\nknow.</p>\n\n<p><sup>57</sup> Seek not your Self in symbols. There can <em>be</em> no concept that can\nstand for what you are. What matters it which concept you accept while\nyou perceive a self which interacts with evil and reacts to wicked\nthings? Your concept of yourself will still remain quite meaningless.\nAnd you will not perceive that you can interact but with yourself. To\nsee a guilty world is but the sign your learning has been guided by the\nworld, and you behold it as you see yourself. The concept of the self\nembraces all you look upon, and nothing is outside of this perception.\nIf you can be hurt by anything, you see a picture of your secret wishes.\nNothing more than this. And in your suffering of any kind, you see your\nown concealed desire to kill.</p>\n\n<p><sup>58</sup> You will make many concepts of the self as learning goes along. Each\none will show the changes in your own relationships as your perception\nof yourself is changed. There will be some confusion every time there is\na shift, but be you thankful that the learning of the world is loosening\nits grasp upon your mind. And be you sure and happy in the confidence\nthat it will go at last and leave your mind at peace. The role of the\naccuser will appear in many places and in many forms. And each will seem\nto be accusing <em>you</em>. Yet have no fear it will not be undone.</p>\n\n<p><sup>59</sup> The world can teach no images of you unless you <em>want</em> to learn them.\nThere will come a time when images have all gone by, and you will see\nyou know not what you are. It is to this unsealed and open mind that\ntruth returns, unhindered and unbound. Where concepts of the self have\nbeen laid by is truth revealed exactly as it <em>is</em>. When every concept\nhas been raised to doubt and question and been recognized as made on no\nassumptions which would stand the light, then is the truth left free to\nenter in its sanctuary, clean and free of guilt. There is no statement\nthat the world is more afraid to hear than this:</p>\n\n<p><sup>60</sup> <em>I do not know the thing I am and therefore do not know what I am\ndoing, where I am, or how to look upon the world or on myself.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>61</sup> Yet in this learning is salvation born. And what you are will <em>tell</em>\nyou of Itself.</p>\n\n",

You do not understand how what you see arose to meet your\nsight. For if you did, it would be gone. The veil of ignorance is drawn\nacross the evil and the good and must be passed that both may disappear,\nso that perception finds no hiding place. How is this done? It is not\ndone at all. What could there be within the universe which God created\nthat must still be done?</p>\n\n<p><sup>65</sup> Only in arrogance could you conceive that <em>you</em> must make the way to\nHeaven plain. The means are given you by which to see the world that\nwill replace the one you made. Your will be done! In Heaven as on earth,\nthis is forever true. It matters not where you believe you are nor what\nyou think the truth about yourself must really be. It makes no\ndifference what you look upon nor what you choose to feel or think or\nwish. For God Himself has said, “Your will be done.” And it <em>is</em> done to\nyou accordingly.</p>\n\n<p><sup>66</sup> You who believe that you can choose to see the Son of God as you\nwould have him be, forget not that no concept of yourself will stand\nagainst the truth of what you are. Undoing truth would be impossible.\nBut concepts are not difficult to change. <em>One</em> vision, clearly seen,\nthat does not fit the picture as it was perceived before will change the\nworld for eyes that learn to see, because the concept of the <em>self</em> has\nchanged. Are <em>you</em> invulnerable? Then the world is harmless in your\nsight. Do <em>you</em> forgive? Then is the world forgiving, for you have\nforgiven it its trespasses and so it looks on you with eyes that see as\nyours. Are <em>you</em> a body? So is all the world perceived as treacherous\nand out to kill.</p>\n\n<p><sup>67</sup> Are you a spirit, deathless and without the promise of corruption and\nthe stain of sin upon you? So the world is seen as stable, fully worthy\nof your trust; a happy place to rest in for a while, where nothing need\nbe feared but only loved. Who is unwelcome to the kind in heart? And\nwhat could hurt the truly innocent? Your will be done, you holy Child of\nGod. It does not matter if you think you are in earth or Heaven. What\nyour Father wills for you can never change. The truth in you remains as\nradiant as a star, as pure as light, as innocent as Love Itself. And you\n<em>are</em> worthy that your will be done!</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>68</sup> Learning is change. Salvation does not seek to use a means as yet too\nalien to your thinking to be helpful nor to make the kinds of change you\ncould not recognize. Concepts are needed while perception lasts, and\n<em>changing</em> concepts is salvation’s task. For it must deal in contrasts,\nnot in truth, which has no opposite and cannot change. In this world’s\nconcepts are the guilty “bad;” the “good” are innocent. And no one here\nbut holds a concept of himself in which he counts the “good” to pardon\nhim the “bad.” Nor does he trust the “good” in anyone, believing that\nthe “bad” must lurk behind. This concept emphasizes treachery, and trust\nbecomes impossible. Nor could it change while you perceive the “bad” in\n<em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>69</sup> You could not <em>recognize</em> your “evil” thoughts as long as you see\nvalue in attack. You will perceive them sometimes, but will not see them\nas meaningless. And so they come in fearful form, with content still\nconcealed, to shake your sorry concept of yourself and blacken it with\nstill another “crime.” You cannot give yourself your innocence, for you\nare too confused about yourself. But should <em>one</em> brother dawn upon your\nsight as wholly worthy of forgiveness, then your concept of yourself\n<em>is</em> wholly changed<em>. Your</em> “evil” thoughts have been forgiven with his,\nbecause you let them all affect you not. No longer did you choose that\nyou should be the sign of evil and of guilt in him. And as you gave your\ntrust to what is good in him, you gave it to the good in you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>70</sup> In terms of concepts, it is thus you see him more than just a body,\nfor the good is never what the body seems to be. The actions of the body\nare perceived as coming from the “baser” part of you and thus of him as\nwell. By focusing upon the good in him, the body grows decreasingly\npersistent in your sight and will at length be seen as little more than\njust a shadow circling round the good. And this will be your concept of\n<em>yourself</em>, when you have reached the world beyond the sight your eyes\nalone can offer you to see. For you will not interpret what you see\nwithout the Aid that God has given you. And in His sight there <em>is</em>\nanother world.</p>\n\n<p><sup>71</sup> You live in that world just as much as this. For both are concepts of\nyourself which can be interchanged, but never jointly held. The contrast\nis far greater than you think, for you will love this concept of\nyourself because it was not made for you alone. Born as a gift for\nsomeone not perceived to be yourself, it has been given <em>you</em>. For your\nforgiveness, offered unto him, has been accepted now for <em>both</em> of you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>72</sup> Have faith in him who walks with you, so that your fearful concept of\nyourself may change. And look upon the good in him that you may not be\nfrightened by your “evil” thoughts because they do not cloud your view\nof him. And all this shift requires is that you be <em>willing</em> that this\nhappy change occur. No more than this is asked. On its behalf, remember\nwhat the concept of yourself which now you hold has brought you in its\nwake, and welcome the glad contrast offered you. Hold out your hand that\nyou may have the gift of kind forgiveness which you offer one whose need\nfor it is just the same as yours. And let the cruel concept of yourself\nbe changed to one which brings the peace of God.</p>\n\n<p><sup>73</sup> The concept of yourself which now you hold would guarantee your\nfunction here remain forever unaccomplished and undone. And thus it\ndooms you to a bitter sense of deep depression and futility. Yet it need\nnot be fixed unless you choose to hold it past the hope of change and\nkeep it static and concealed within your mind. Give it instead to Him\nWho understands the changes that it needs to let it serve the function\ngiven you to bring you peace that you may offer peace to have it yours.\nAlternatives are in your mind to use, and you <em>can</em> see yourself another\nway. Would you not rather look upon yourself as <em>needed</em> for salvation\nof the world instead of as salvation’s enemy?</p>\n\n<p><sup>74</sup> The concept of the self stands like a shield, a silent barricade\nbefore the truth, and hides it from your sight. All things you see are\nimages because you look on them as through a barrier which dims your\nsight and warps your vision, so that you behold nothing with clarity.\nThe light is kept from everything you see. At most, you glimpse a shadow\nof what lies beyond. At least, you merely look on darkness and perceive\nthe terrified imaginings that come from guilty thoughts and concepts\nborn of fear. And what you see is hell, for fear <em>is</em> hell. All that is\ngiven you is for release—the sight, the vision, and the inner Guide all\nlead you out of hell with those you love beside you and the universe\nwith them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>75</sup> Behold your role within the universe! To every part of true creation\nhas the Lord of Love and Life entrusted <em>all</em> salvation from the misery\nof hell. And to each one has He allowed the grace to be a savior to the\nholy ones especially entrusted to his care. And this he learns when\nfirst he looks upon <em>one</em> brother as he looks upon himself and sees the\nmirror of himself in him. Thus is the concept of himself laid by, for\nnothing stands between his sight and what he looks upon to judge what he\nbeholds. And in this single vision does he see the face of Christ and\nunderstands he looks on everyone as he beholds this One. For there is\nlight where darkness was before, and now the veil is lifted from his\nsight.</p>\n\n<p><sup>76</sup> The veil across the face of Christ, the fear of God and of salvation,\nand the love of guilt and death, they all are different names for just\none error—that there is a space between you and your brother, kept apart\nby an illusion of yourself which holds him off from you and you away\nfrom him. The sword of judgment is the weapon which you give to the\nillusion of yourself that it may fight to keep the space that holds your\nbrother off unoccupied by love. Yet while you hold this sword, you must\nperceive the body as yourself, for you are bound to separation from the\nsight of him who holds the mirror to another view of what he is and thus\nwhat <em>you</em> must be.</p>\n\n<p><sup>77</sup> What is temptation but the <em>wish</em> to stay in hell and misery? And\nwhat could this give rise to but an image of yourself that <em>can</em> be\nmiserable and remain in hell and torment? Who has learned to see his\nbrother <em>not</em> as this has saved himself, and thus is he a savior to the\nrest. To everyone has God entrusted all, because a partial savior would\nbe one who is but partly saved. The holy ones whom God has given each of\nyou to save are everyone you meet or look upon, not knowing who they\nare, all those you saw an instant and forgot, and those you knew a long\nwhile since, and those you will yet meet, the unremembered and the not\nyet born. For God has given you His Son to save from every concept that\nhe ever held.</p>\n\n<p><sup>78</sup> Yet while you wish to stay in hell, how could you be the savior of\nthe Son of God? How would you know his holiness while you see him apart\nfrom yours? For holiness is seen through holy eyes that look upon the\ninnocence within and thus expect to see it everywhere. And so they call\nit forth in everyone they look upon that he may be what they expect of\nhim. This is the savior’s vision—that he see his innocence in all he\nlooks upon and sees his own salvation everywhere. He holds no concept of\nhimself between his calm and open eyes and what he sees. He <em>brings</em> the\nlight to what he looks upon, that he may see it as it really is.</p>\n\n<p><sup>79</sup> Whatever form temptation seems to take, it always but reflects a wish\nto be a self which you are not. And from that wish, a concept rises,\nteaching that you <em>are</em> the thing you wish to be. It will remain your\nconcept of yourself until the wish that fathered it no longer is held\ndear. But while you cherish it, you will behold your brother in the\nlikeness of the self whose image has the wish begot of <em>you</em>. For vision\n<em>can</em> but represent a wish, because it has no power to create. Yet it\ncan look with love or look with hate, depending only on the simple\nchoice of whether you would join with what you see or keep yourself\napart and separate.</p>\n\n<p><sup>80</sup> The savior’s vision is as innocent of what your brother is as it is\nfree of any judgment made upon yourself. It sees no past in anyone at\nall. And thus it serves a wholly open mind, unclouded by old concepts\nand prepared to look on only what the present holds. It cannot judge\nbecause it does not know. And <em>recognizing</em> this, it merely asks, “What\nis the meaning of what I behold?” Then is the answer given. And the door\nheld open for the face of Christ to shine upon the one who asks in\ninnocence to see beyond the veil of old ideas and ancient concepts held\nso long and dear <em>against</em> the vision of the Christ in you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>81</sup> Be vigilant against temptation, then, remembering that it is but a\nwish, insane and meaningless, to make yourself a thing which you are\nnot. And think as well upon the thing that you would be instead. It is a\nthing of madness, pain, and death; a thing of treachery and black\ndespair, of failing dreams and no remaining hope except to die and end\nthe dream of fear. <em>This</em> is temptation, nothing more than this. Can\n<em>this</em> be difficult to choose <em>against</em>? Consider what temptation <em>is</em>,\nand see the real alternatives you choose between. There <em>are</em> but two.\nBe not deceived by what appears as many choices. There is hell or\nHeaven, and of these you choose but <em>one</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>82</sup> Let not the world’s light, given unto you, be hidden from the world.\nIt <em>needs</em> the light, for it is dark indeed, and men despair because the\nsavior’s vision is withheld, and what they see is death. Their savior\nstands, unknowing and unknown, beholding them with eyes unopened. And\nthey cannot see until he looks on them with seeing eyes and offers them\nforgiveness with his own. Can you to whom God says, “Release My Son!” be\ntempted not to listen when you learn that it is <em>you</em> for whom He asks\nrelease? And what but this is what this course would teach? And what but\nthis is there for you to learn?</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><sup>83</sup> Temptation has one lesson it would teach in all its forms wherever it\noccurs. It would persuade the holy Son of God he is a body, born in what\nmust die, unable to escape its frailty and bound by what it orders him\nto feel. It sets the limits on what he can do; its power is the only\nstrength he has; his grasp cannot exceed its tiny reach. Would you <em>be</em>\nthis if Christ appeared to you in all His glory, asking you but this:</p>\n\n<p><sup>84</sup> <em>Choose once again if you would take your place among the saviors of\nthe world, or would remain in hell and hold your brothers there.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>85</sup> For He <em>has</em> come, and He <em>is</em> asking this.</p>\n\n<p><sup>86</sup> How do you make the choice? How easily is this explained! You always\nchoose between your weakness and the strength of Christ in you. And what\nyou choose is what you think is real. Simply by never using weakness to\ndirect your actions, you have given it no power. And the light of Christ\nin you is given charge of everything you do. For you have brought your\nweakness unto Him, and He has given you His strength instead.</p>\n\n<p><sup>87</sup> Trials are but lessons which you failed to learn presented once\nagain, so where you made a faulty choice before, you now can make a\nbetter one and thus escape all pain which what you chose before has\nbrought to you. In every difficulty, all distress, and each perplexity\nChrist calls to you and gently says, “My brother, choose again.” He\nwould not leave one source of pain unhealed nor any image left to veil\nthe truth. [He would remove all misery from you, whom God created\naltars unto joy.] He would not leave you comfortless, alone in dreams\nof hell, but would release your minds from everything that hides His\nface from you. His holiness is yours because He is the <em>only</em> power that\nis real in you. His strength is yours because He is the Self that God\ncreated as His <em>only</em> Son.</p>\n\n<p><sup>88</sup> The images you make can <em>not</em> prevail against what God Himself would\nhave you be. Be never fearful of temptation then, but see it as it\nis—another chance to choose again and let Christ’s strength prevail in\nevery circumstance and every place you raised an image of yourself\nbefore. For what appears to hide the face of Christ is powerless before\nHis majesty and disappears before His holy sight. The saviors of the\nworld who see like Him are merely those who chose His strength instead\nof their own weakness, seen apart from Him. They will redeem the world,\nfor they are joined in all the power of the Will of God. And what they\nwill is <em>only</em> what He wills.</p>\n\n<p><sup>89</sup> Learn then the happy habit of response to all temptation to perceive\nyourself as weak and miserable with these words:</p>\n\n<p><sup>90</sup> <em>I am as God created me. His Son can suffer nothing. And I <strong>am</strong>\nHis Son</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>91</sup> Thus is Christ’s strength invited to prevail, replacing all your\nweakness with the strength that comes from God and that can never fail.\nAnd thus are miracles as natural as fear and agony appeared to be before\nthe choice for holiness was made. For in that choice are false\ndistinctions gone, illusory alternatives laid by, and nothing left to\ninterfere with truth.</p>\n\n<p><sup>92</sup> You <em>are</em> as God created you, and so is every living thing you look\nupon, regardless of the images you see. What you behold as sickness and\nas pain, as weakness and as suffering and loss is but temptation to\nperceive yourself defenseless and in hell. Yield not to this, and you\nwill see all pain in every form wherever it occurs but disappear as\nmists before the sun. A miracle has come to heal God’s Son and close the\ndoor upon his dreams of weakness, opening the way to his salvation and\nrelease. Choose once again what you would have him be, remembering that\nevery choice you make establishes your own identity as you will see it\nand believe it <em>is.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>93</sup> Deny me not the little gift I ask when in exchange I lay before your\nfeet the peace of God and power to bring this peace to everyone who\nwanders in the world uncertain, lonely, and in constant fear. For it is\ngiven you to join with him, and through the Christ in you unveil his\neyes and let him look upon the Christ in him. My brothers in salvation,\ndo not fail to hear my voice and listen to my words. I ask for nothing\nbut your <em>own</em> release. There is no place for hell within a world whose\nloveliness can yet be so intense and so inclusive it is but a step from\nthere to Heaven. To your tired eyes I bring a vision of a different\nworld, so new and clean and fresh you will forget the pain and sorrow\nthat you saw before. Yet this a vision is which you must share with\neveryone you see, for otherwise you will behold it not. To give this\ngift is how to make it yours. And God ordained in loving kindness that\nit <em>be</em> for you.</p>\n\n<p><sup>94</sup> Let us be glad that we can walk the world and find so many chances to\nperceive another situation where God’s gift can once again be recognized\nas ours! And thus will all the vestiges of hell, the secret “sins,” and\nhidden hates be gone. And all the loveliness which they concealed appear\nlike lawns of Heaven to our sight to lift us high above the thorny roads\nwe traveled on before the Christ appeared. Hear me, my brothers, hear\nand join with me. God has ordained I cannot call in vain, and in His\ncertainty I rest content. For you will hear, and you will choose again.\nAnd in this choice is everyone made free.</p>\n\n<p><sup>95</sup> <em>I thank You, Father, for these holy ones who are my brothers as they\nare Your Sons. My faith in them is Yours. I am as sure that they will\ncome to me as You are sure of what they are and will forever be. They\nwill accept the gift I offer them because You gave it me on their\nbehalf. And as I would but do Your holy Will, so will they choose. And I\ngive thanks for them. Salvation’s song will echo through the world with\nevery choice they make. For we are one in purpose, and the end of hell\nis near.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>96</sup> <em>In joyous welcome is my hand outstretched to every brother who would\njoin with me in reaching past temptation and who looks with fixed\ndetermination toward the light that shines beyond in perfect constancy.\nGive me my own, for they belong to You. And can You fail in what is but\nYour Will? I give You thanks for what my brothers are. And as each one\nelects to join with me, the song of thanks from earth to Heaven grows\nfrom tiny scattered threads of melody to one inclusive chorus from a\nworld redeemed from hell and giving thanks to You.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><sup>97</sup> <em>And now we say “Amen.” For Christ has come to dwell in the abode You\nset for Him before time was, in calm eternity. The journey closes,\nending at the place where it began. No trace of it remains. Not one\nillusion is accorded faith, and not one spot of darkness still remains\nto hide the face of Christ from anyone. Thy Will is done, complete and\nperfectly, and all creation recognizes You and knows You as the only\nSource it has. Clear in Your Likeness does the Light shine forth from\neverything that lives and moves in You. For we have reached where all of\nus are One, and we are home, where You would have us be.</em></p>\n\n",
